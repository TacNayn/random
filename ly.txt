I get it, I say as I pout
I tried to put together all the things
I want to tell my lover who I'll meet someday
Doesn't "MY LIST"...look impressive?

Be sure to contact me, every single day
Let me hear that you'll love me forever over and over
Always!

Call me by my name, no need to bother with formalities
Let's walk, hand in hand, not minding what anyone else thinks

When I stay quiet it's because I can't say it,
I'll show you this list, and try acting a bit spoiled
My lover who I'll meet some day, don't be shocked
"MY LOVE"...where will we meet?

Don't keep saying you're busy
If you keep putting off my feelings of love,
I'll start to cry!

When you leave me to go out, buy me a souvenir and come back
Even if you don't know my star sign, just remember my birthday

Let me hear that you love me all the time
Don't you want to say it?

There's lots and lots more, but let's leave it for after we meet,
To look forward to
Who are you? Where are you?
C'mon, come to me quickly, quickly, show me your face
Hey, come to me quickly!/nDoing your best is for yourself
That’s so tiring
Let’s embrace someone else’s smile
Let’s create the future together

People who can do it all
Are the heroes in all our dreams
Dreams are fun while dreaming
You won’t do everything in a flash, You won’t do everything perfectly
I want you to take care of yourself as well

A little bit of courage
Will illuminate my heart, Do you know? (Lovely)
Sparkle, Can I do! (Find it)
It’s a true miracle (You-see-Do-your-best!)

Hey-you
Maybe the method for doing your best is different?
Don’t keep worries to yourself
Becoming sad is no fun
Doing your best is for yourself
That’s so tiring
Let’s embrace someone else’s smile
Let’s create the future together

I received a shock as we passed each other
Rather than fortune wasn’t it through great effort?
If you accept that the impossible is impossible
I’m sure you’ll be able to, You’ll be able to do it perfectly
Perhaps you’ll be able to take more punishment than today

With a little bit of courage I’ll fly too
Lead the way, Can you hear? (Without fail)
Be enthusiastic, Do I do! (Search)
I’m really waiting (Here-goes-Don’t-give-up!)

Here-goes
Don’t give up, Beyond our destination
Is the blue sky after the rain
The droplets burst out in sparkles
You won’t give up, right? Beyond the fog
Is a brilliant new world so
Leave behind all the weariness and let’s go
Let’s move forward gently and strongly

Hey-you
Maybe the method for doing your best is different?
Don’t keep worries to yourself
Becoming sad is no fun
Doing your best is for yourself
That’s so tiring
Being together is great, I want to keep smiling
Sympathy of smiles

Here-goes
Don’t give up, Beyond our destination
Is the blue sky after the rain
The droplets burst out in sparkles
You won’t give up, right? Beyond the fog
Is the warm light of a new world
Leave behind all the weariness and let’s go
Let’s move forward gently and strongly, Let’s move forward!/nLet's nom on cheeseburgers on the way back
Or slurp some ramen!
But munching on waffles suits girls better
What should we do? Can't decide? Yep!

Should we go? I want to go
If we can't decide, we should just go
We can't even decide it by majority vote
After school, after school

It's not good to be too greedy
But our expectations are rising
My heart is pounding
After school, after school

Will it be sweet? Let's caramelize it
Should we give up if it's spicy? If it's just a bit, it's stimulating!

Rather than stammering "Well, but--"
If you like it, just say so
Regrets don't suit you!

I want to say I'm having fun every day
Even if it's not much, it's still a happy moment
You want to say you're having fun every day, right?
Since we're so close, we can share these thoughts
"It's so yummy!"
We can't stop eating
We want seconds
We gulp down our drinks at the same time
After school, we are NAVIGATORS!

Yeah!
Eat, drink, laugh!

After eating, I'm thirsty now
Slurping this ramen makes my forehead sweat~
I want to munch on these waffles forever
What should we do? Are you satisfied? Yeah!

Let's buy it and see; I want to buy it
Let's find out how it tastes!
It might have some maniacal flavor
Tea break now, tea break now

It's not good to stuff your mouth too much
Because before you know it
Your tongue will be shaking
Tea break now, tea break now

These octopus dumplings are so hot!
Shall we cool down with a polar bear? I want a lot, not just a bit, please!

Say things like "Look... I want more..."
There's nothing wrong with liking the things you do
No need to reconsider

I want to say I'm happy forever
It's best when there's a blue sky in my heart
You want to say you're having fun forever, right?
Since we're so close, we can nod and agree - "It really is yummy!"
Yummy!
I want to say I'm having fun every day
Even if it's not much, it's still a happy moment
You want to say you're having fun every day, right?
Since we're so close, we can share these thoughts - "It's so yummy!"

We can't stop eating
We want seconds
We gulp down our drinks at the same time
After school we, after school we, after school
We are NAVIGATORS! Yay!
Yeah!/nLet's deliver happiness and smiles to everyone...

I think I'm starting to understand the sound that flows through my body
Our meeting wasn't unexpected
It's a miracle that we're so attracted to each other

It's important to have a dazzling smile that believes in the future

Love is like a sun, a big sun
The sunflowers lift their heads to follow it
Love is like a sun, illuminating the world
I want to bloom with the sunflowers
I want everyone to be full of joy!

Let's always be singing with a smile...

That's right, your eyes were so gentle as you frolicked
Before the tears began to spill
You nodded beautifully at me

Do your best, my heart; tomorrow we'll be going to a new world

The clouds of love bask in the light
And are softly enveloped in it
The clouds of love bring with them a warm breeze
Let's feel it together
And prepare to embrace everyone now!

Do your best, my heart; this is important
Now, a new future will be born for you and I

Love is like a sun, a big sun
The sunflowers lift their heads to follow it
Love is like a sun, illuminating the world
I want to bloom with the sunflowers
I want everyone to be full of joy!

Let's deliver happiness and smiles to everyone.../nCheers for the love!

I'm glad to be here, our present exists right here
Cheers for the love!
It’s only just begun, I'm counting on you again tomorrow, we've yet to reach our goal


Smile when you're sad, let's blow it all away
If you can laugh, the scenery will change, peeking through the clearing weather
Even when you're unsure, the road leading to happiness
Comes into view under the blue sky

Rain falls from time to time but it's harsh without water
Don't wither, nurture everyone's tree of dreams

Now!
Cheers for loving you!
With the courage to never give up, let's enjoy the present
Cheers for loving you!
We can do our best so wave goodbye to yesterday and look forward


Push forward even if it's difficult, I'm by your side
When we push forward, the burning sun will illuminate the east
The confusing, answer-less road to the future
Is something we can't say no one knows

The silver light falls into the sudden storm
Don't panic, everyone's tree of dreams are strong

Now!
Cheers for the love!
I'm glad to be here, our present exists right here
Cheers for the love!
It's only just begun, I'm counting on you again tomorrow, we've yet to reached our goal


Rain falls from time to time, the trunks sway in the wind
We'll go together, nurture everyone's tree of dreams

Now!
Cheers for loving you!
With the courage to never give up, let's enjoy the present
Cheers for loving you!
We can do our best so wave goodbye to yesterday and look forward/nWhy is it, that the piercing wind fills the streets
Why is it, that the sunset is full of pain
The leaves of the autumn-colored trees are my love,
They all seem like they're about to fall

Does my voice reach you?
The sky I asked, foretells a labyrinth of love

Because I love you (Because I love you) And because I love you (And because I love you)
Please hug me
I want to know your true feelings clearly


That's right, the traces of the swimsuit aren't fading
That's right, the sandals aren't being kept away
The summer-colored memories are my love
I want to experience our season once more

Even now, I'm still struck by the disease of wanting to meet you
My passionate heart is in pain, lost in a labyrinth of love

Even if it's impossible (Even if it's impossible) It's not impossible (It's not impossible)
Let's start it all again
I knew it all along, you're my destiny


Does my voice reach you?
Even now I still want to meet you, I want to meet you right now

Because I like you (Because I like you) And because I like you (And because I like you)
Please hug me
I want to know your true feelings clearly
Even if it's impossible (Even if it's impossible) It's not impossible (It's not impossible)
Let's start it all again
I knew it all along, you're my destiny/nAfter school, when everyone has left, in the corner of a hallway,
The dance hall is my own - a stage no one else knows of

It was a day like any other. I was practicing by myself,
And covered in sweat, when you happened to pass by

Every time we talk, a feeling in my chest starts overflowing
Like watching a good comedy, and I'm enveloped in happiness

May one of these days I become your ideal heroine
I'm bad at ad lib-ing. Lead me through with a nice scenario
The lines I memorized over and over, just don't come when I look in your eyes
So for now, please let me perform beside you simply as a junior partner

Unlike all the times before, my practicing alone
Doesn't feel so harsh ever since I've met you

Now, the expressiveness I've since lacked, I have
The curtain is rising quietly on the second chapter of my story

I want to be one who can bring a smile to someone else
But most of all, I want to bring a smile to you

May one of these days I become your ideal heroine
I'm bad at ad lib-ing. Lead me through with a nice scenario
The lines I memorized over and over, just don't come when I look in your eyes
So for now, please let me perform beside you simply as a junior partner/nLonely my love. lonely my heart
I'm not a flower bud
Lonely my love. lonely my heart
I want to be picked

Longing for kindness, being hurt by kindness
I'd never wanted to experience these feelings,
I can't handle them

Your heart is so distant, I want to cry
But even so, I've decided I will wait
For you, my first love

Anemone heart, my lonely heart
The tears of a flower blooming alone
Gaze at me more, I'm right here
Anemone heart; Affection runs throughout my body
Someday, our loving heartbeats will meet

Lonely my love. lonely my heart
I'm not a flower bud
Lonely my love. lonely my heart
I want to be picked

Entrapped by the pain in my heart,
I embrace the pain
I've never stopped wishing
but you can't hear me, can you?
I want to monopolize you, I can't wait anymore
Let's believe in a dream which links us together,
my very first love

Acacia heart, my lonely heart
The language of flowers seems to hold secrets
Feel me more, I'm right here
Acacia heart; Drawn by excitement, I'm swept away
But, you see, I can't say it, I love you...
「I love you...」

Anemone heart, my lonely heart
The tears of a flower blooming alone
Gaze at me more, I'm right here
Anemone heart; Affection runs throughout my body
Someday, our loving heartbeats will meet

Lonely my love. lonely my heart
I'm not a flower bud
Lonely my love. lonely my heart
I want to be picked/nWhere is this place?
Wait, even if you don't say it, I already know
It's a warm mirage I saw in my dreams
Who are you?
I won't ask because I already know
This is an encounter called forth by our wishes

The first star that shines brighter the further it gets
I always wanted to try a romance like that
My heart's brakes are no longer needed
We were born just to meet and become a pair

Ah! I don't want "Maybe"
I'm an Angel that prefers "More"
I won't let my wings be mere decorations
Ah! Though I don't want "Maybe"
I'm an Angel that likes "More"
I've realized what's important isn't tomorrow
But rather the present instead
My pounding heartbeat can't be stopped


We've always believed in it and understood,
that our encounter was for us to collide with each other

The colder it gets the hotter the flames of my steps
That's right, I'll bet everything for the sake of love
Come, let yourself be attracted, just enough to get hurt a bit
This sparkling tear, is it from joy or from sympathy?

Ah! This passion will last only for this night, and never again
We'll have to dance until this passion burns out
Ah! This passion will last only for this night, and never again
"If you catch me, keep holding on to me tightly," I whispered
This precious dream has yet to end

I knew that time couldn't be stopped
So I wanted to meet you much earlier
I'll let the words I want to convey dissolve into this sound, and Call Angel!


Ah! I don't want "Maybe"
I'm an Angel that prefers "More"
I won't let my wings be mere decorations
Ah! Though I don't want "Maybe"
I'm an Angel that likes "More"
I've realized what's important isn't tomorrow
But rather the present instead
My pounding heartbeat can't be stopped/nLet's chase the orbit of unseen dreams!

Shining Road
My feelings run
as I'm vigorously looking for you,
Wait a minute! This can't be,
It's the courage that touches us inside

The world's always full of
(more) hidden new doors
(Let's go!) I want to open them,

Let’s go and take hold of our dreams
No matter what happens, even if we don't understand, let's look forward to it

Open Mind
We have to say it but we can't
Since no one should be able to do it perfectly from the start
For now, let’s fly energetically
From our start line, I wonder if the goal is far away.

In this shining world, I heard you call out for me
(More) I wanted to hear you
(Let’s go!) Towards the other side of the light
Let’s go together!

I want to change my future (So, where to) by rising up like the sun
Our dreams shined  Charging heart
Let’s use all our strength to grant our desires  Isn’t youth surprising!?
“I want to change,” I thought (Sunshine mission) Our feelings are surely important
Let’s go and take hold of our dreams
If it’s with everyone, it’s fine even if I can’t explain it

Jumping heart  But the fact that I want to start
Charging heart  I found it just about now
Where is the goal? I wonder where it is? I don’t know
I don’t know, but let’s still have fun

I want to start my story; The blue sky is waiting for us,
It's a jumping heart that embraces our dreams,
a youth that advances straight to tomorrow,

Yaa-Yaa!!/nTo be shaken by the winds of time is my destiny
But even so, for love; I will fight for love

It's not the end just yet (I don't want to give up)
Ah, it was forbidden (My feelings are growing)
I can't find any salvation, even though I pray

Just staring at each other (Forget about everything)
Time was what I wanted (Words are unneeded)
Run away? That's not allowed! Each of our wishes remain ungranted

In the next world (I want to meet you again)
After being born again (I want to meet you again)
Let's vow to find happiness this time round (Let's vow)
Come on, through that door (I'm sending you off)
Come on, after you leave (You'll depart)
Don't turn back, alright (Disappear immediately... please!)
We won't meet again

Within dreams, our souls (Inside our dreams) are drawn to one another (For the sake of love)
No matter where our bodies are, you can hear my voice, right?
Within dreams, our souls (Inside our dreams) are drawn to one another, so (For the sake of love)
It's not something sorrowful, right? Because we're always together
Just staring at each other (Forget about everything)
Time was what I wanted (Words are unneeded)
Run away? That's not allowed!
Each of our wishes remain ungranted, no matter how much I pray

That day, it seemed like I fell in love at first sight
It feels like it was just yesterday
That day, when I believed that someday the two of us would definitely be tied together...

The next world is (Because we'll meet again)
A peaceful world (Because we'll meet again)
Let's vow to definitely find happiness (Let's vow)
Come on, through that door (I'm sending you off) Come on, after you leave (You'll depart)
It'll be bad to call after you (Disappear immediately... please!)
Even if my tears are overflowing

Holding on to illusions (Holding on to dreams) We continue living on (Holding on softly)
After quietly keeping these memories warm in our eternal love
Holding on to illusions (Holding on to dreams) We continue living on (Holding on softly)
Even the faint warmth of your kiss is good enough

To be shaken by the winds of time is my destiny
But even so, for love; I will fight for love
(Let time stop right now... Please!)
A flame of revolution...

Within dreams, our souls (Inside our dreams) are drawn to one another (For the sake of love)

Run away? That's not allowed!
Each of our wishes remain ungranted, no matter how much I pray/nI'm sure that I would've been better off ignorant
Holding such pain in my chest,
I smiled each day, not saying a word about it
and told myself to forget

I shut away my memories, heartbreak

With this clichéd sadness and clichéd pain,
I barely hold back tears and watch the stars
They shine brighter than usual, and seem to fall
As they quietly illuminate me...

These feelings will settle down gradually
As time passes, you too will fade
When will this become a distant memory?
Time has passed, you have faded

I repeatedly question why, heartbreak

My never-ending sadness and never-ending pain
Flow like the waves until dawn breaks
My feelings swirl more violently than usual
And I feel as though I could fall apart completely

Should I sleep? The moon eventually grows light
A gentle dream falls upon my chest

With this clichéd sadness and clichéd pain,
I barely hold back tears and watch the stars
They shine brighter than usual, and seem to fall
As they quietly illuminate me.../nWhen I start I never really think about
How it'll end or anything like that
It seems like it'll go on forever, so I only look ahead
Since that's how I've been running until now
Where, where where shall I go next?

Come on! Awaken the power, yeah!
Are you ready? Let's go!!

Even though I'm supposed to know a lot of words
At times like this, they won't come out
My heart is filled with these strong emotions
And I feel like I'll cry before I can say anything

Once I've decided to do my best (I definitely won't lose)
I've always worked hard with everyone (I definitely won't lose)
I won't know that I can't do it until I try
What's awakening inside of me is a new power
My power, new power, yeah!

I'm sure the world is shining with unknown power
So I'll keep on dreaming forever
I'm sure the world is shining with unknown power
What I'll choose depends on me
Wake up my new power
The power sleeping within me starts to move
Start up now don't just stand there, let's go!
Where, where, where shall I go?

Even when I'm happy, my tears flow
And erase my pain (washes them away)
The things I worried about before, I feel
Are now completely gone - I've really grown
Fighting fighting!
Fighting fighting!

Didn't we decide to do our best (I definitely won't lose)
We worked at it together (I definitely won't lose)
If we can't do something, we'll challenge it over and over
From failure to success, I want to change the future
My power new power
Fighting fighting! New power! Yeah!

I'm sure the world is shining with unknown power
So I'll keep on dreaming forever
I'm sure the world is shining with unknown power
What I'll choose depends on me
Wake up my new power
The power sleeping within me starts to move
Start up now don't just stand there, let's go!
Where, where, where shall I go?

My power new power in the depths of my heart
My power new power looking for a new world
Wake up wake up my new world/nSimply kind words aren’t enough anymore
Trembling I sigh, You’re so close I want to to try touching you

Getting this close was not by chance and yet
Feigning ignorance and showing off a smile is a crime

As we walk side by side, pausing our conversation
I want a button for love (Clicking and ordering) Let’s start

At the beginning we got a little closer
I reflect on the happiness that came from meeting
Forever (baby) Forever (maybe)
I won’t forget how my heart pounded
It’s always okay
Our meeting invites tomorrow
It would be great if I could tell you (Because I want to tell you)
We stopped suddenly and gazed at one another...

If these feelings catch a ride on the wind and tickle your ears
You should be able to hear my warm and sweet thoughts

I tried imagining it but I don’t understand at all
I planned to know but I don’t understand the real you

This secret is a frustration, expanding selfishly on its own
There’s a single button for love (As soon as it was clicked) Things started

Suddenly handling it with a joke
Your evasive eyes are lost
But (sorry) But (worry)
I don’t want it to be painful
It’s okay in front of your eyes
Because I’ll promise, Because I love you
Feeling this strongly (I want to say it right now)
Still unable to say it we gazed at one another...

At the beginning we got a little closer
I reflect on the happiness that came from meeting
Forever (baby) Forever (maybe)
I won’t forget how my heart pounded
It’s always okay
Our meeting invites tomorrow
It would be great if I could tell you (Because I want to tell you)
We stopped suddenly and gazed at one another... Did I click the button?/nBreak down!

Well? Signs of a slight fever
Come a little closer
I know!! Let me cure that for you

Even if you just sit there I still know
You're in pretty bad shape
Your chest feels hot, it feels painful
You've done it (at last), you've fallen in love

Soon...
"I want to be alone with you disease" has befallen you
Let me give you a sweet medicine

Beat in Angel
Have fun, temporary as it may be
Seriously?! Angel
My needle doesn't hurt at all
If you meet my gentle eyes you'll be numb from passion
Prepare yourself - you can't escape
Feather-covered Angel Beat!!

Oh,baby! Dance dance Angelic!!
Oh,baby! Dance dance Angelic!!
Oh,baby! Dance dance Angelic!!
Wow...

Hey! You're not allowed to move
I'll hug you tightly
You know? The beat is growing more dangerous

We can't just stay simply friends
Your symptoms are awful
Sigh (turmoil) sigh (suspicious)
You've done it (come on), how's love feel?

Anyhow...
"I want to steal your lips disease" has befallen you
Let me give you a strong medicine

Love in Angel
I'll make you feel intense, captive to premonition
Seriously?! Angel
My hand softly, softly touches you
It makes me want to put you into a daze, earnest shy boy
I want you to tell me you won't run
Whimsical Angel Love!!

Beat in Angel
Have fun, temporary as it may be
Seriously?! Angel
My needle doesn't hurt at all
Beat in Angel
Have fun, temporary as it may be
Seriously?! Angel
You and me, that's bad, risky, dangerous
If you meet my gentle eyes you'll be numb from passion
Prepare yourself - you can't escape
Feather-covered Angel Beat!!

Oh,baby! Dance dance Angelic!!
Oh,baby! Dance dance Angelic!!
Oh,baby! Dance dance Angelic!!
Wow.../nI promise I won't laugh!
Isn't it fine the way it is?
I don't really mind even if it is weird at first
What's important is you'll "like" every day!

3, 2, 1, Go!/nThis year's summer has a different scent than usual
This year's summer is hiding an intoxicating scent

I wish I could be a little more mature right now
I've felt this way ever since I first heard your voice
So turn around...

What will be my next dream?
A premonition of unknown sorrow
It's scary, but I don't want to run away... this fever is a mystery
What is this sudden new dream?
A premonition of unknown excitement
I want to learn more from you (Is it a coincidence? Or...)
I can't do anything by myself!

Swaying in this year's summer, I thought of changing my hairstyle
Swaying in this year's summer, I blush as I wear my swimsuit

I'm always watching you passionately, though it's embarrassing
Why won't you notice my gaze?
Hurry and turn around...

Under the scorching rays of the sun
I really am too shy
But your kindness hurts... my first love is a mystery
Under the sweet rays of the sun
I'm too shy to speak
I have a request for you (I want my heart to beat faster)
Please fall in love with me!

Hurry and turn around... (Face me)
This love is overflowing

What will be my next dream?
A premonition of unknown sorrow
It's scary, but I don't want to run away... this fever is a mystery
What is this sudden new dream?
A premonition of unknown excitement
I want to learn more from you (Is it a coincidence? Or...)
I can't do anything by myself!/nIt's beginning to run, the Berry Berry Train
Sweet and sour

Mr. Mirror, please teach me
Make me as cute as you can!

All girls worry about this 
For now, fashion is max priority!

Leave it on? Take it off? I turn around 
Does the ribbon look good on my hair?

Yan yan, I'm going to be late!
Oh no, dash to the station!
Will I start my first date off with an apology?
Yan yan, that would be bad!
Oh no, train, please hurry!
This uneasy feeling is sour, Blueberry Train

Mr. Clock, please listen to me
Please stop ticking, just for a little bit

It's an excuse all girls give
It's inevitable for the sake of looking pretty

Open it? Or maybe not? Repeating that in my head
Fiddling with the button on my chest

Really, I thought about it a lot
There's no time to reconsider!
It would be the worst to keep my promised date waiting!
Really, I'm hesitating too much
Is it too late to reconsider?
I'm hoping that you'll be a little late, Blueberry Train

Yan yan, I'm going to be late!
Oh no, dash to the station!
Will I start my first date off with an apology?
Yan yan, that would be bad!
Oh no, train, please hurry!
This uneasy feeling is sour, Blueberry Train

Really, I thought about it a lot
There's no time to reconsider!
It would be the worst to keep my promised date waiting!
Really, I'm hesitating too much
Is it too late to reconsider?
I'm hoping that you'll be a little late, Blueberry Train/nThat's right!
I always wanted to shine I wanted to make it all start
While meeting friends along the way we've come to run down a path
Starting from scratch towards a one how difficult could that really be?
But what happened then (But what happened then) that became a connection

That's right!
I didn't understand it and went through tears and sweat
My friends encouraged me and we've come to this path
Look up the grand and blue sky in a day to day I want to tell
That's why we all (That's why we all) Got ourselves giving our all!

Always my dreams are inside my heart
Even if I start to loose their sight
And that's why we are never giving up!
Because we finally saw that light
Even if I became a bit obsessed I believed It'd change, I believed it 
With all of you 

That's right!
One after another, all my wishes came true
It was nice to have met all my friends and going down this path
But you see there's an end to everything we have started
So where should we go? (Where should we go?) Obviously to our goal!

So all, let's run even further than now
Despite all my care I'm still worried
And that's why we are never going to stop!
Because I want to feel that warmth
And in a very different form 
A new dream I want to see

Aah, what should we do? (Thinking ahead)
Aah, what should we do? (Where should we head?)
Can you see? Can you tell? Our future selves do...?

That's right
As expected from myself I tried to cast a spell
Accepting that I should see them all off, my dear friends, with sorrow
It's not the end, it's all right, let's cheer up, let's laugh it off!
I want to see if (I want to see if) We can still give it some more!

So all, let's run even further than now
Despite all my care I'm still worried
And that's why we are never going to stop!
Because I want to feel that warmth
And in a very different form 
A new dream I want to see

So when the curtain rises up we are going to sing forever
And an endless dream we will see!/nI definitely want to capture new dreams even more than I do now
If I boldly jump out, my life will be O.K.
My hopes are huge
Growing high and far
Let's go embrace a dazzling tomorrow
Let's make all of our dreams come true

That's right! Just by believing
You'll move forward steadily, yes, you will!

You don't have to give an answer since I understand
The place drawn in our hearts is the same
Never giving up, searching for it will be our challenge
Our energetic temperatures won't go down
We feverishly flap our wings
When you talk about your aspirations,
I love the unyielding expression in your eyes… I love it!

Even when you cry, the sky will stay blue, the color never-changing
I want to see you right away, O.K. sunshine
I want to feel what it's like to line up with you
I don't need a reason if I'm next to you
I'll tell you right away
Why our feelings are getting so close

That's right! Everyone has a single
Fragment of courage that they carry, even you!
We'll be together forever

It's a great plan so let's chase after it
And search for a place that makes our hearts dance
We'll stumble, get back up and be able to gaze at each other on our joyous adventure
I wonder how far our smiles will reach
I don't need things like promises but,
I want to be with you no matter what
Rushing by together, we shine… We shine!


You don't have to give an answer since I understand
The place drawn in our hearts is the same
Never giving up, searching for it will be our challenge
Our energetic temperatures won’t go down
We feverishly flap our wings
When you talk about your aspirations,
I love the unyielding expression in your eyes… I love it!/nHonest feelings tie everyone together
Even when we’re being serious we’re clumsy, Our hearts clash
But even so, I want to see. 
A big dream's right here. It’s only just begun

(I know)
It’s not just fun and games. We have to be tested
(I know)
Even though hardship lies in the future
(I’ll go)
When we come together we get stronger
(I’m sure) We’ll continue to change (We’ll be stars!)

If each of us can put our hearts into the things we love
A new (place) will be our goal
If we trust in the things each of us loves
We can (embrace) the excitement and move forward

(Leave your fears behind) With a brilliant smile
(Fly, fly high) We are in the present

Instead of just thinking about it, let’s all run together
Tomorrow is incomplete, We can’t predict it
It’ll just happen, A miracle is inevitable
This is just the start of everything

(I know)
For sure in times of sadness let’s look up
(I know)
The world will become more magnificent
(I want it)
I want to carry the radiance in my chest
(Firmly) So let’s compete together (We can fly!)

I feel that there’s no time to look back
I’ll spread (With you) Everywhere
I know there’s no time to look back
We’ll build anticipation for the stimulus

(Farewell to my weak self) Don’t put it out with a smile
(Fly, fly high) With us amidst the present

For our dreams to grow (We have to be tested)
The fire in my chest takes over (my temperature)
It’s so hot (it’s too hot) so it won’t stop
A risky bet? Let’s go win it!

If each of us put effort into the things we love
A new (place) will be our goal
If we trust in the things each of us loves
We can (embrace) the excitation and move forward

(Leave your fears behind) With a brilliant smile
(Fly, fly high) With us through the present
(Farewell to my weak self) Don’t put it out with a smile
(Fly, fly high) We are in the present

We've waited to shine/nAh! It began with a subtle premonition
Ah! Our wishes were hung amidst the starry skies
Our joyful smiles that make flowers bloom,
They were always the same, smiles of friendship

We won't ever forget this, until the end of time
That our hearts can become one like this
We've discovered the world
So let us sing with joy until the very end

The little bird's wings have finally grown large
It's a day to take flight
The wide sea's warm color beckons in the distance
It's painful, just like a painting drawn within a dream
Would you like to try winding back time?
No no no, this moment is the greatest!

These encounters with everyone
Were so joyful I never wanted to let go, it's true
Our tears are unneeded, let's just dance like this
Wave your hands, wave them more

We made it here chasing the light. Because it's us,
We won't say farewell
We'll meet again, won't you call me?
We're a dream
That connects to a wonderful future
A future we dreamed of
Our LIVE & LIFE with you


The little bird's wings have finally grown large
It's a day to take flight

After all, after all, this moment is the greatest!

Ah! It began with a subtle premonition
Ah! We made it here chasing the light.../n/nI've taken off running! Off to strengthen my feelings
When I'm worried I'll grip your hand tight

I've always betrayed my most important feelings
But yesterday, I said bye-bye
To the risks and regrets
That I've searched for over and over as excuses
I'll stop letting them control me

My feet are moving, it might be scary at first
But a heart that wants to keep going is all I need!

I've taken off running! Off to strengthen my feelings
When I'm worried I'll grip your hand tight
You don't have to wait to be who you want to be
My dream will one day shine forth!

I won't fight this fight with half-baked feelings
There's not a single regret left on the stage
Because when I compare my ideals and my reality
Though I've yet to reach it
I can feel the goal at the end of the road

We need hard work and persistence, there will be sleepless nights
But it's your "I want to see your smile!". Yes, as long everyone's here!

I'm springing off! My feelings aren't a lie
The hope born from my tears
Connects me to a strength my eyes can't see
My dream will one day shine forth!

I only need to close my eyes to see it again
My heart beating, I'll entrust the future I believe in here
The moment the world takes on colors and shines
I want to see it with you, my heart answers

I've taken off running! Off to strengthen my feelings
When I'm worried I'll grip your hand tight
You don't have to wait to be who you want to be
My dream will one day shine forth!

Connects me to a strength my eyes can't see

Anyway, we will start to regret it if we don't start right now
We should do something so we need to force ourselves to fly

(Don't lose heart, how boring!)
Don't worry, don't worry!
(No hesitation, Go go!!)

Allow me to teach you the feel of an icy burn
Don't worry, don't worry! 
So, so passionate
Deeply in love, you want to know my serious answer
Don't worry, don't worry! 
(No hesitation, go, go!!)/nThis moment is precious
Being rushed toward destiny
That moment when we were holding each other was our sign of farewell

I'll be waiting, always waiting
Those drifting words
They do not vanish in the wind; they definitely exist in the warmth of my chest

The day you will go to the ends of the Earth, seeking the things you believe in
Will you stick with this unstoppable way of living
I just pray for you, all alone.

Oh how heartless...
This world is full of sorrow
But even that is fine,
Having met is a joy, isn't that right?

So don't lose
Don't twist your heart
I prepared for farewell with the 'you' that was smiling

Wait for me, always wait for me
Communicating with our eyes,
I'll wait at the place of our memories, until the day you return.

What sort of tomorrow can you see? That's right, a tomorrow of hope
Will you continue with this unstoppable way of living?
I just watch over your direction, all alone.

Oh how heartless...
But the world wishes for happiness
Even so
I want to feel the meaning of our encounter... Oh how heartless!

Oh how heartless...
This world is full of sorrow
But even that is fine,
Having met is a joy, isn't that right?

Oh how heartless...
But the world wishes for happiness
Even so
I want to feel the meaning of our encounter... Oh how heartless!/nHave the signs disappeared...?
My breathing is rough and violent just like the clues we follow 
We're searching while not wanting to ever find it
But as soon as we do, we must take the chance to strike

Why must you be an enemy? (Surely nobody knows)
When I'm so attracted to you (I don't know the truth)
It must be a bad dream

This Daydream of light and darkness (daydreamer)
Beyond that black door,
What awaits me is (Destiny's) embrace of my Lost Love
At the very least, I must forget your kindness from that day
Wiping the sweat from my brow, I swear I'll end it all with my own hands

Feigning not hearing the voice of my heart
As I begin to run, my contradictions waver
These beloved feelings, these unforgivable feelings
I want to confirm them; weakness is painful

Why did I ever meet you? (My burning chest flutters)
I felt a definite link between us (I wanted to believe it wasn't a lie)
But this illusion has crumbled to pieces, hasn't it?

My prayers and love are a Daydream (Daydreamer)
Dreams can only be dreams
At the end of grief (Destiny is) now an unchanging Lost love
Until I can overcome it, I'll swallow back those tears
With my back against a dark wall, I will sharpen my senses for battle

I want to return to this day...to the day we met...
But this one wish of mine won't come true; it must be a bad dream

This Daydream of light and darkness (daydreamer)
Beyond that black door,
What awaits me is (Destiny's) embrace of my Lost Love
At the very least, I must forget your kindness from that day
Wiping the sweat from my brow, I swear I'll end it all with my own hands/n/nWhy do I feel so cold? (feel so mute)
Being stared at with intensity (feel so dizzy)
I wanna get fired up yet why (feel so nude)
Diamond princess style

Even if I carry a brilliant shimmer
Something’s missing…Agitating my heart

Things like pretty girls swaying in dreams
Are affairs which should stay in movies
That’s something no one understands
Begone! Words like “Protect me…” won't leave my mouth
Rather than being a frail and fragile thing, I want to melt in the flame of passion
You up to the challenge?

Love me to the point of caution (get my love)
I wanna cry painfully (Trembling all over)
Closing the lid on reason (get my love)
The princess wars are gonna break out

Seduce me, embrace me madly
If I forget about it all… I won’t need tomorrow

Rather than a guardian clad in light
I whispered that I want the fragrance of darkness instead
That’s no good, huh? You don't get it
Visions of a disappearing future -- nobody wants to see that
Do you understand? A frightened prince is a bore, you know
I want to stay the way I am -- electrifying

Sparkling princess, Sighing princess
Being ordinary’s a no-no, no more safety
While I, the melancholic princess, am awake
I want my heart to be thrown into disarray

Things like pretty girls swaying in dreams
Are affairs which should stay in movies
That’s something no one understands
Begone! Words like “Protect me…” won't leave my mouth
Rather than being a frail and fragile thing, I want to melt in the flame of passion
You up to the challenge?/nC-c-c-conveying my feelings is really hard!
But I'll do my very very very best to reach you
I-i-i-i-it doesn't really show on my face
But joy and anger, grief and pleasure, all those emotions
Make my heart race recklessly ba-dump ba-dump, pipo pa po!

When the day comes that I can show you my face
I want to be there smiling
I'm sending my feelings on radio waves, be-be-be-be-beam!
A network of hearts connecting me with you!

My tremors won't stop My heart's throbbing cheerfully
It's because you're here that I can be honest too
It's sparkling and shining, I'm waiting on that stage
No matter who I am, I'll be just as I am
And jump out into this new world!

I-I-I I want to show you how much fun I have dancing!
In my song too I'll do my very very best, I want to convey those feelings!
E-e-e-even if it's not going well now, and I'm stumbling through, 
I'm diligently practicing every day
Until the moment I get it perfect, my heart beats ba-dump ba-dump pipo papo!

If I can someday become a wonderful person
I want to always be shining
Wire up those radio waves, be-be-be-be-beam!
A communicator connecting me with you

R-I-N-A-C-H-A-N B-O-A-R-D Rina-chan board!
R-I-N-A-C-H-A-N B-O-A-R-D Rina-chan board!
Everyone, thank you!

No matter what difficulties come
I'll face them and overcome them
The courage to not give up goes pipo papo!

One day, one day, one day, when I can show you my face
I want to be there smiling
I'm sending my feelings on radio waves, be-be-be-be-beam!
A network of hearts connecting me with you!

No matter when, forever, and always
I won't forget this joy
It's as though my heart is in analog, b-b-b-b-bzzzz
It'll spread and be accessed everywhere, this miracle

My tremors won't stop My heart's throbbing cheerfully
It's because you're here that I can be honest too
It's sparkling and shining, I'm waiting on that stage
No matter who I am, I'll be just as I am
And jump out into this new world!/nI'm feeling happy, so I'll go see you
I'm feeling lonely, so I'll go see you (Going to see you)

That's the feeling I have 
Whether I'm moving forward or whether i'm in distress
We'll always be connected

With our earnest dream (Hi! Let's go!)
We'll capture tomorrow (Hi! Go go!)
If it's you, I know you definitely can do it!

Every now and then, let's take things at an easier pace
And take a good look at the things you want to do
From there, try your hardest with all of your might! (Let's work hard!)
And let our clear feelings soar into the sky

Every moment, I'll always be gazing right at you

I'm feeling happy, so I want to be by your side
I'm feeling sad, so I want to be by your side (I'll be with you)

Even if I can't say anything, 
I wonder if you'll try embracing me
I want to tell you… that I love you!

Serious dreams are (Hi! Let's go!)
Just a little bit bitter (Hi! Go go!)
When it gets painful, let's just laugh it off

You gently and strictly encourage me
All these thoughts and wishes, let's grant them all
So let's work hard together with all of our might! (Let's work hard)
We will shine brightly in the future

Be strong, don't stop being yourself
Be strong, you don't need to rush accepting yourself
That is the most important thing

Every now and then, let's take things at an easier pace
And take a good look at the things you want to do
From there, try your hardest with all of your might! (Let's work hard!)
And let our clear feelings soar into the sky

Every moment, I'll always be gazing right at you
Because I'm happy, I want to meet you
Because I'm lonely, I want to meet you
Whether times are fun or sad,
I will want to meet you no matter when/nThe area of the dream we were searching for
You, too, were laughing while running towards it
Shall I wipe your sweat off for you?
Even while holding back, I threw you a towel

It's a feeling that we can go anywhere
Luggage and schedules, all those are unneeded

No matter who Go!(Go!) Go!(Go!) Let's try flying off into the distance
Go!(Go!) Go!(Go!) Don't tell me that it's impossible
Go!(Go!) Go!(Go!) In any case, just aim straight ahead
Go!(Go!) Go!(Go!) I want to meet more exciting things

Dreamin' never disappearing
Dreamin' Sensation

There's no spare time to be discouraged
What's important is that you don't stop
Over the hills and over the mountains
Say goodbye to the puny self you were

No matter when, always show your seriousness
And the parts of your personality no one knows

Unyielding Go!(Go!) Go!(Go!) Wanting to seize the future
Go!(Go!) Go!(Go!) The momentum allows us to keep advancing
Go!(Go!) Go!(Go!) And if we were to ever meet sadness
Go!(Go!) Go!(Go!) Even that is just the spice of life

Smiling If it's you
Smiling You would understand, right?

Unyielding Go! Go! Wanting to seize the future
Go! Go! The momentum allows us to keep advancing

No matter who Go!(Go!) Go!(Go!) Let's try flying off into the distance
Go!(Go!) Go!(Go!) Don't tell me that it's impossible
Go!(Go!) Go!(Go!) In any case, just aim straight ahead
Go!(Go!) Go!(Go!) I want to meet more exciting things

Dreamin' never disappearing
Dreamin' Sensation/nEven though you've come so far
The answer is still beyond your reach
The light you thought you had grasped was only an illusion
Swallowed up by the darkness

DROPOUT!?
An abandoned passion stuck in an unexpected situation
What I regret is losing a sensation

Just where is that "shine"
You said you'd gain no matter what?

Even so Go to the world
Search for the edge
Of this unstoppable dream without exits
Go to the world
Loneliness is only distorting us
Who do you want to call for?

Having always been searching for meaning
That heartbeat of yours has been screaming
Wanting to see something certain
You have always been running
And have been loved by the darkness

Dropout!?
Pessimistic curation 
Navigating towards evilness
You say that you don’t want that
Block your imitation

Unable to see the colour of the sky
But you can feel the radiance!

Out of the world pain
Splits the chest
Picking up the spilling fragments of dreams
Out of the world
After lamenting
One day it will move
So raise your face

Power that cannot be suppressed
Feelings that you don’t know how to deal with
Even when you’re unable to paint the future
Those dreams are still restless

Even so Go to the world
Search for the edge
Of this unstoppable dream without exits
Go to the world
Loneliness is only distorting us
Who do you want to call for?/nThe way you’re always here by my side is something I’ve thought of as a regular thing,
But I’ll cherish it more.
Let’s dream and laugh – I don’t want to lose that.

We’re friends. La la la la… Forever!


As we share the same experiences,
We take the same steps toward adulthood.
Things will keep going that way forever, I expect…
I want to find out for sure, but I don’t really know how.

Even if I have faith that things won’t change,
Just a little bit of loneliness crept in
When I was watching the profile of your face.

The way you’re always here by my side is something I’ve thought of as a regular thing, (La la la la)
But tomorrow just might hold one step down a different road.
The way you’re always here by my side is something I’ve thought of as a regular thing, (Always…)
But I’ll cherish it more.
I don’t want to lose you – don’t let go of my hand.

We’re friends. La la la la… Forever!


I tried to pretend I was strong,
So I actually became strong – we’ve tried so hard together.
Not being alone is a happy feeling.
You’ve listened to me in times of worry – you’ve saved me.

Inside, I wish that things won’t change.
Is that just me being selfish?
But it would really be great if we could stay together, on and on…

Dreaming, laughing, crying – let those days we spent together shine bright. (La la la la)
They’re a treasure more radiant than any precious stones.
Dreaming, laughing, crying – those days we spent together are so dear to me. (Dreaming…)
I’d like to add on even more,
Though we haven’t decided what we should aim for next.

We’re friends. La la la la… Forever!
Don’t say that it’s just for now – this is eternal.
Don’t say that it’s just for now – wow, wow…

I want to see the dream, together with you.
I want to see the dream, to laugh and cry… Ah!

The way you’re always here by my side is something I’ve thought of as a regular thing, (La la la la)
But tomorrow just might hold one step down a different road.
The way you’re always here by my side is something I’ve thought of as a regular thing, (Always…)

I want it to reach, all the way to you
ENDLESS PARADE Fun dreams are
Never ending, that's our slogan

I say "Together"
You say "Let's fly!"
Aah, if we just dance more and more intensely

Let's forget about the time, with no end in sight
The happy music is resonating
dance dance because
dance dance I love you!
Our PARADE/nI close my eyes and the scenery of my hometown comes to mind
Just with that I'm calm and at ease
Even you or anyone would be, too

This faraway town that I came from
For sure this will not change:
The wind blowing through the Earth, and the people who live there, too

The sky and the Evergreen that spread everywhere
The setting sun welcomes all!
I want to give it a hug, just like that; and everybody's heart, too
Now everyone, I'll sing this wish out!

The room is lit with the moonlight shining outside
I was so happy when we all smiled today

Even if there is a day when we all part ways
This unchangeable present will not come twice!

The Evergreen song that has always been loved
The humming melody that envelopes everyone!
And I hope to be like that! Hope for my future self
And right now,
I'm singing this wish out!

Everyone is drawing the things they cherish
Let's dance while we think too
La la la...

Under this clear blue sky with no cloud at all
Let's walk forward looking up
And never ever letting go of our hands...

The sky and the Evergreen that spread everywhere
The setting sun welcomes all!
I want to give it a hug, just like that; and everybody's heart, too
Right now, I'll sing this wish out!

La la la la la.../nI want to gaze at you every day
I want to gaze at you from morning to night

When I feel your gentleness even through your nonchalant act
I get the feeling that the two of us can become happy

When I'm with you (I want to be) our hearts (with you)
Draw closer to each other, don't they?
And forever (the two of us)
We will chase our dreams together

I'm always counting every wonderful moment we share
I feel like the loving heartbeats you give are protecting me
I want to tell you that
So I tug on your hand a bit

It's through your nonchalant act that your gentleness shines
And I know without a doubt that the two of us can become happy
I believe...

When this overflowing fondness started to feel like second nature
I made up my mind, I'll definitely become happy, with you...

If I say aloud (I want you) that I want to be with you (to be with me)
We'll both know for certain then, right?
And forever (the two of us)
We will coat our dreams with a new shine, and chase after them

I'm always playing our shared memories over in my mind
This bond of love ties me to you so that I'll never let go
I wanted to tell you that, so
Hey, come a bit closer to me

I'm always counting every wonderful moment we share
I feel like the loving heartbeats you give are protecting me
And when I go to tell you that
My tears spill out, a little bit...

I'm always playing our shared memories over in my mind
This bond of love ties me to you so that I'll never let go
I wanted to tell you that, so
Hey, come a bit closer to me

With this overflowing fondness feeling like second nature
I know without a doubt that the two of us will become happy
I believe.../nI wanted you to listen to me, that's what I've always thought
Anyway, if we just try to start moving
The future will be born bit by bit within each new day

We still want to challenge ourselves, we can do it
Let's all chase those sparkling days together

Future style
I want to meet you, so please wait for that moment
Someday upon that stage we hoped for
That exists only here within this world
Future style
I want to meet you, so please wait for that moment
Now is the time I want to grant all our wishes; I wish starting
It's time for our greatest dreams to take shape
Your voice... I can hear it!


Just a little bit of courage can be the trigger
What's really inside you is courage that makes you want to fly high
If you let it out, you'll be able to see a larger stage next time

After all, I definitely want to tell you
Let's put in all our might together and enjoy ourselves

Shiny style
We did our best and jumped, covered in sweat
It's a stage forever bursting with smiles
The world's most wonderful stage
Shiny style
We did our best and jumped, covered in sweat
Beside, in front and even behind us; We love music
Because our greatest dreams seem to be taking shape
Come on everyone... Future party!

Our hearts are one, everyone's dancing while dreaming of the same miracle
This is the Love Live we dreamed of!

Let's go!!

Someday upon that stage we hoped for
That exists only here within this world
Future style
I want to meet you, so please wait for that moment
Now is the time I want to grant all our wishes; I wish starting
It's time for our greatest dreams to take shape
Your voice... I can hear it!/nFootsteps approach, and I wish that they were yours
Even though I know that can't be right
Those feelings, of wanting to walk close by your side--
I find myself wishing for you to accept them

My unformed words leave my mouth as a chilly sigh
And disappear in an instant, at the street corner where I stand alone
I'm searching for your back among the crowd
Even though I know you can't possibly be there

I should've told you today that I wanted to see you
Now I regret missing that chance
If only I had it in me to pull out my phone, and call you to say
"Come here, come quick, please..."

Hesitating, indecisive, I still can't make up my mind
Even as I count the stars with my fingertips
The day I fell in love -- thinking about it makes my chest hurt
Hesitating, indecisive, I still can't make up my mind
The night's about to end, I have to make my choice soon, but...
Falling in love has made me a bit of a coward, huh?

Footsteps approach, and I wish that they were yours
Even though I know that can't be right
Those feelings, of wanting to walk close by your side--
I find myself wishing for you to accept them

When I stopped to pick up the decorative lights that had fallen from the window
I suddenly felt like crying
I got the vague sense that I'd be seeing you today
But I want to believe it's more than just a gut feeling

I wish I'd told you outright that I wanted to see you
But I stubbornly bit my tongue for no real reason
I think I'll try going to our usual place
Just in case you'll be there...

Hesitating, indecisive, I still can't make up my mind
The night's about to end, I have to make my choice soon, but...
Falling in love has made me a bit of a coward, huh?

Once I've started running, even while trembling from the cold
My cheeks and heartbeat began growing hot
The day I fell in love -- thinking about it makes tears fill my eyes
Once I've started running, even while trembling from the cold
I can see someone waving at me from the distance
I'm sure it must be you, rushing towards me...

Footsteps approach -- your footsteps
Are heading straight towards me
Those feelings, of wanting to walk close by your side--
With those same feelings, you run towards me

'cause I wanna go have fun!
Even if it's totally out there, we'll do it

This is way too sudden! No!
I don't really get it, but it sounds like fun!
So tell me, tell me, what should we do?

Hey, that sounds good! Let's all get dressed up
All of us waltzing together,

Shall we dance?
Let's dance like it was a dream
We're tonight's unforgettable Cinderella
I'll take off my shoes quickly and lightly, so I won't lose them
Who should we invite? I'm getting riled up!


It’s no trouble at all, Surprise!
I want to see your happy faces
So I’ll make your every wish come true

Don’t tell me you were serious?! Stop!
Oh man, this is awesome, my heart’s pounding
All of us together, let’s have a dance party!

The biggest chandelier you’ve ever seen sparkles marvelously
The swelling violins gracefully summon the stars’ shine
The champagne glasses await for us to take them atop the silver tray
Makes you a little nervous, huh?
But don’t panic! Just smile real bright, like a princess!

Shall we dance?
Let us twirl and spin around like Cinderella
The aria makes us a little sleepy
So we gotta enjoy ourselves to the limit, until we’re all worn out!
Let’s dance forever! It's so exciting, right?

Shall we dance? Shall we dance?
Of course, let’s dance!
Let’s Dance!! Step with me!!

Come on, let’s do the Viennese Waltz together!

Shall we dance?
Shall we dance?
Let's dance like it was a dream
We're tonight's unforgettable Cinderella
I'll take off my shoes quickly and lightly, so I won't lose them
Who should we invite? I'm getting riled up!
Let's dance forever, let's dance forever! It's so exciting, right?/nPerhaps the real me was born
On a place not on Earth
I've always been lonely, where is the one
That understands my heart?
Ah, in this maze, I'm all alone!

"I'm here!" I can hear someone's voice say
Please, guide me with that gentle voice!
With just that, it seems like
I can come to really like this planet.
Let's hurry and meet each other,
I'm calling calling you!

That person is also on a trip searching for me
How is it that I know that?
I have to find you, the one who understands my heart
Are you waiting for me?
The exit...is it close?

If you could tell me with telepathy where you are now
We'll be connected, and it will the start of a miracle
From then on I can make more and more
Wonderful memories on this planet
So let's meet each other

The world is wide, but it's fate that we will definitely draw each other
It's like we're playing hide-and-seek
Please don't say "not yet!"

Is this the last step? The person
That understands my heart is waiting
That someone is... you!

"I'm here!" I can hear your voice say
Please, guide me with your gentle voice!
With just that, it seems like
I can come to really like this planet.
Let's hurry and meet each other,
I'm calling calling you!/nA maze of dreams... A maze of lilies...

When your eyes filled with longing
Are searching far away
I feel such loneliness
And want to tell you I'm right here

Ah! Just the two of us, to the Garden of Glass
There's no one else; we don't need anyone else
I want to bloom softly as if I'm about to break

On our secret swing
Swinging with you now
Just gazing at each other softly
A girl who's fallen in love with love; her quiet sigh is 
Lonely... contented and lonely...

So that your heart that I wish to capture
Won't go anywhere
Please stay here with me forever
It's lonely

Ah! In the maze of dreams, the glass butterflies
While tempting me, they're being tempted
I'll flap my fingers, as though they're about to break

Our secret romance
And even though I want to feel you
All we can do is painfully gaze at each other
The feelings we can't have as girls who are in love with love
Why do they have to be so painful?

We'll fall asleep in our Flower Garden
I love your hand as it strokes my hair; more...

Our secret romance
And even though I want to feel you
All we can do is painfully gaze at each other
The feelings we can't have as girls who are in love with love
Why do they have to be so painful?
On our secret swing
Swinging with you now
Just gazing at each other softly
A girl who's fallen in love with love; her quiet sigh is 
Lonely... contented and lonely...

A maze of dreams... A maze of lilies.../nYo!Yo! Going at full throttle from the morning on!
Hey!Hey! Everyone is exhilarated as well, right? 
Yo!Yo! It feels like we can do anything!

I was just struck with an idea, so
I want to meet soon...! I want us to come together and talk...!
I just couldn't wait, and woke up early!

The morning air has the scent of greenery and salt,
and I inhale big, deep whiffs of it!

Running quickly up the hillside road, Ahh!someone's back
can be seen from the distance! Good morning!
I dash forward with my hand raised! You'll notice it, right?

What will today be like? (What kind of day? DAY! DAY! DAY!)
Ahh~ Definitely an energetic, full speed day! 
Hey, listen to me!
I have an idea that seems fun, so
let's gather after school! (No refusing!)
With a meaningful voice I say: See you later!

Yo!Yo! Going at full throttle from the morning on!
Hey!Hey! Everyone is exhilarated as well, right? 
Yo!Yo! It feels like we can do anything!

After eating lunch, I became sleepy, so
I closed my eyes for a bit... I'm not sleeping, you know! I'm not asleep!
I'm just taking a break! A short one, ok?

The commotion outside the window is like a lullaby...
Wait What? I need to wake up!

I stre~tched in the back, Ahh someone's calling me!
I try to hide my bedhead and greet them: Hello!
When I'm in a pinch, I wear an embarrassed grin... Did you find me out?

What should I start talking about? (What should I start from?)
Let's decide when the time comes!

What will today be like? (What kind of day? DAY! DAY! DAY!)
Ahh~ Definitely an energetic, full speed day! 
Hey, listen to me!
I have an idea that seems fun, so
let's gather after school! (No refusing!)
With a meaningful voice I say: See you later!/nFall in love with my Guilty Eyes
(shutdown shutdown) Guilty Fever
I won’t give it to anyone; this
(shutdown shutdown) Guilty Fever

You can’t decide yes or no clearly
Laughing while hiding your intentions is your bad habit
If you don’t choose everyone will disappear
(Everyone, everyone) They will disappear

There's no shame in being greedy
As long as it’s not a lie, I’ll accept it
Please confess with no worries
Just come at me (More, more)
I want to know it

My Guilty Eyes have always been aiming at you
And I want to capture all of your existence
You are my love

You can’t run away!
Shutdown to a world with only two of us
There’s no need for anyone else
I want you to try saying that you love me
I’m honest; Look into my eyes 
(love with Fever)

I won’t give it to anyone; this
(shutdown shutdown) Guilty Fever

My own heart is getting excited,
Admit it, your fire's been lit and
There's surely a reward waiting for good children!
(I'll give you, give you) A sweet kiss

You wanted to experience true love, right?
Say goodbye to indecisiveness!
Throw it to me;
The invitation to your heart
(Become, become) A scorching hot love

In what sort of dream do you want to embrace?
It's because it's you that I tremble with hesitation
(love me love you)
I want to touch you now!

up down We'll shine bright together in this chaos
Finally joining as one Guilty soul
Because I love you, watch me
Open the door to passion
No matter what may come (love with secret)
I want to confirm it (Guilty secret)

What sort of dream should we have?
One from which we'll never wake up
I want to know more
About you, about you
And then, I'll capture you!
you are my love

You can't run away!
Shutdown to a world with only two of us
There’s no need for anyone else
I want you to say that you love me
I'm honest!
Look into my eyes (love with fever)
I'll have you love me deeply (Guilty fever)
No matter what may come (love with secret)
I want to confirm it (Guilty secret)

I won’t give it to anyone; this
(shutdown shutdown) Guilty Fever/nKiss!
I want to fly to you and take you away, so
I don't need a response, it's useless to argue
Kiss!!
Your indifferent manner's just a lie, isn't it?
I already know there's heat in your eyes

Being bold is just my nature
If I say it like that 
Leave it to instinct, there's nothing else
Hey, come over here

"Guilty Kiss" After everything has passed, you and I will fall in love…yes!!

Guilty Night, Guilty Kiss, Guilty Night, Guilty Kiss!

Touch!
Playing a sinful trick on your heart
A meaningful wink, it's only superficial courtesy
Touch!!
Instead of a trap, call it magic
That way, you feel like you can't help it

Acting like I'm messing around, even though I'm serious
It's fun that way 
This way is better than being calm
Hey, come here

You dancing dancing

"Guilty Night" I want to be lit up by starlight
"Guilty Night" Forget everything 
"Guilty Night" What was the meaning of our meeting? Until we find out we'll be shaking my song

I won't do it in a roundabout way like acting like I want you to invite me
I might seem too strong, oh yeah!
When I miss you I want to go right to you, passion!
You should feel that way too
It's selfish, but it's love, it's destiny
And I don't feel like changing it
When I miss you I want to go right to you, I won't restrain myself
I want to steal away the things I desire. Guilty Kiss!

This guilty party will never end. Hey!!/n/nI see the ends of the sky
And also the distant world that nobody knows about
The small stars shine
Surely in the same night sky

So don’t forget
In just a short amount of time
Miracles are engraved by the heart
Gently waiting for tomorrow

Tender wishes (from kindness)
Wavering thoughts… That’s right…
It’s not only gently being by your side
Change is beginning. Do you understand?

Fragments of a dream shake the wings
Once again becoming a lovely song
They want to shine within that light
Spread your wings and heat up this evening

Because I always want to rescue you
Because I want to support you, let’s give it my all
If I think "I am able to do anything"
I will become strong

Gentle and yet (kind)
Delicate… That’s right…
Let’s go towards the important things sooner
Little by little when I get closer

Drops of a dream soak the wings
Just tightly embrace this moment
If this light doesn't go out
Spread your wings and let’s protect this evening

That’s right, the power of hope will surely transmit through our overlapping hands
Now, within the quiet slumber
Tomorrow will be reborn, ah surely…

Fragments of a dream shake the wings
Once again becoming a lovely song
They want to shine within that light
Spread your wings and heat up this evening

What rose from those pair of trembling wings?
Spread your wings and let’s protect this evening/nA fanfare played in my heart when we met
You'll never lose your passion
That's what I believe

Instead of sitting comfortably, I want to go on adventures
Smiles on our faces, jumping high
Our time never pauses
We'll continue to seek our radiance

Do your best, do your best! Wonderful things
Lie in store for you right ahead
I'm OK, I'm OK!　I'm not giving up!
We'll be happiness makers tomorrow too!
Do your best, do your best! Give it a try
And something wonderful will happen
I'm OK, I'm OK!　I wanna shout it out!
"Let's go! Together, always!"

The music I play is overflowing with my wishes
Let's talk about them, one by one, and then move on
Towards a new future

Off toward new discoveries, off on a trip
Our hopes burn on, it's a brand new day
Let's stand in new, fun places
The forecast for excitement is as strong as ever

It's all okay, it's all okay! Let's have fun
Our energy makes us invincible
Let's smile, let's smile! We won't lose heart
We'll be happiness makers every day!
It's all okay, it's all okay! Have fun
Our energy makes us invincible
Let's smile, let's smile! Can you hear us?
"Dance! I love everyone!"

Instead of sitting comfortably, I want to go on adventures
Smiles on our faces, jumping high

Let's smile, let's smile! Can you hear us?
"Dance! I love everyone!"/nIs this the fragrance of an open flower? I've received this next dream
Now, where should we go?
Should we go as if we were leaping ahead?
Repeating (the farewells) and the beginnings

What I want to meet is a new kind of excitement, a newborn wish's warmth
I want to embrace it
I want to lightly go towards it with my memories stuffed inside my pocket

Let's go on a wonderful journey
After all, life connects us to so many places
It's nothing but thrilling!

Carrying along these feelings, we'll go to the HAPPY HAPPY TRAIN!
Tomorrow is calling
If our eyes are shining with hopes, we can see it
In this distant train station, something is waiting for us

What I want to know is wonderful daybreak, a sunset that would house my pain
That's why I have to go now
Alone if I have to, singing to myself my memories

I won't worry about the small things
I want to always be smiling
Let's go on a never ending journey
Life just makes us sigh sometimes
As thrilling as it can be

When I rode with no hesitation on the PARTY PARTY TRAIN
There were surprising people by my side
How far does the rail go? I still don't know
I want this PARTY TRAIN to run forever


Carrying along these feelings, we'll go to the HAPPY HAPPY TRAIN!
Tomorrow is calling us
When I rode with no hesitation on the PARTY PARTY TRAIN
There were surprising people by my side
If our eyes are shining with hopes, we can see it
In this distant train station, something is waiting for us
Ah, the Happy Train goes anywhere, doesn't it?/nWith the power of love, shall we try to fly?
Because something is waiting for us over there
Oh yeah! That's right...!

If we can't understand difficult things
Then let's communicate with our smiles
Thank you, because I met you
I'm really glad, for these enjoyable days

Though I felt like there was
Other emotions I wanted to convey
Shall we dance? (That's right) Let's dance (More)
Get on the rhythm
HEART to HEART to HEART!

With the power of love, shall we try to fly?
Because something is waiting for us over there
With the power of love, I want to fly
If you say those words it'll come true, it'll definitely come true!
(Come on, you have to say it) Try shouting it out loud

If it's easy things we understand them
If you believe in love you can hang in there
(Hang in there ONEDAY)
Thank you, meeting you was
a wonderful fate; these happy days (are wonderful, aren't they)

Hold on to all the memories (There're loads of them)
I'm counting on you from here on too, and
Shall we dance? (That's right) Let's dance (More)
This won't end
HEART to HEART to HEART!
(1,2,3,4! This can't end!)

This dreamscape, is what everyone wants to see
And has been wishing for all this time
This dreamscape, is what everyone wants to see
If you say those words it'll come true, it'll definitely come true!
(Come on, loudly) Believe in the power of love
This dreamscape (Together with everyone)
Let's watch it together (Together with everyone)
With the power of love (Together with everyone)
Let's watch it together (Together with everyone)

With the power of love, shall we try to fly?
Because something is waiting for us over there
With the power of love, I want to fly
If you say those words it'll come true
This dreamscape, is what everyone wants to see
And has been wishing for all this time (Forever and ever)
This dreamscape, is what everyone wants to see
If you say those words it'll come true (Come on, you have to say it)
It'll definitely come true! Try shouting it out loud!
(Come on, you have to say it) Try shouting it out loud/nHello, called by the music
the brightly lit town seems like a carnival!
Hello, if we try answering it
I’m sure our world will expand bit by bit.
Hello.

Shall we join in the dancing at the intersection?
Everything feels so free here!
It feels like we’ll be swallowed
by the oncoming wave of people!
We don’t know the words to this melody
but strangely it fills up with strength!

Hello, if we count the stars
and start to divine what we will come across in the future,
Hello, it will be impossible to foretell.
But I’m sure if we’re together we can enjoy anything!
Hello, what will happen when we wake up tomorrow?
What should we do?

Filled with excitement, I feel something is about to start!
Everything feels so radiant, we stretch out our hands high.

I wonder what this excitement is…
Our own lively rhythm,
our tempo is set, feels like we can fly into the night sky!
A brand new melody,
we don’t know the words to this melody
but strangely it fills up with strength!

Hello, it’s a message from the stars
so let’s touch upon our dreams while we’re full of energy!
Hello, this warmth is eternal.
I’m sure if we’re together we can enjoy anything!
Hello

I love new world!
Ah, this is a new world!
This feeling of always wanting to try new things
will never disappear, will it?
It will always bring us happiness, won’t it? (That’s right!)
The stars (shine) the stars (glitter) are so pretty!
See, they fill us up with strength!
(Everyone, everyone!)

Hello, it’s a message from the stars
so let’s touch upon our dream as we’re full of energy!
Hello, this warmth is eternal.
I’m sure everything will be fun if we’re together!
Hello

Hello, if we count the stars
and start to divine what we will come across in the future,
Hello, it will be impossible to foretell.
But I’m sure if we’re together we can enjoy anything!

Hello, what will happen when we wake up tomorrow?
What should we do?/nDon’t talk about the unreachable dreams
Is this the act of the beauty that seems to disappear?
I start wanting to feel the freezing lights
It’s strange that the heart is covered in mystery, isn't it?

In the unknown world, if I were to see and meet you
I begin wanting to convey it to you

I hurt someone
To not care is to not be sorry
Ah… the desire to violently run past
As it is, no matter the place, we will both go fall together
Is this time a sin?

Just lock up these unreachable feelings
Sadness gives me a reward

Although the overlapping worlds distort
It’d be nice if the two of us could take it in

Demolish the future
To not be afraid is to not grieve
Ah… There’s no need for tender hopes and the like 
Being torn off by those eyes, we will both go fall together
This prayer is any and all sin

In the unknown world, I see you and meet you too
The present and unchanging sorrow
In that case, although the worlds already distort
It’d be nice if the two of us could take it in

I hurt someone
To not care is to not be sorry
Ah… the desire to violently run past
As it is, no matter the place, we will both go fall together
If this time is a sin
This prayer is also a sin, right?/nNonstop nonstop the music
Nonstop nonstop the hopping heart

Why is it we seem too small maybe it's just us
But, but
Somehow, somehow it's a lot the things we've came through though
This looks like out of a dream

The things that I've never could have done
Alone used to be impossible but
With the power we've garnered together
They have become fun

Yes!
For us the future is ahead of the present
We have to get tightly a hold of ourselves
And then with our wings of freedom we will have to Fly away!!

Thrilled and full of joy let's all do it
If we dance we will come as on around the world
Come on! Come on! Come on!
Let's get together
Thrilled and full of emotion you should do it
Let your heart dance along and connect with everyone
This is something lovely we'll never stop to do　Yeah, that's right!

The like for what you like it's uncomparable
But, but
Why is it why is it too hard to explain it to everyone
Because there's no reason

So!
My future, that is something I decide myself
Playing it always safe it's really boring
Even though my wings are wet they're big so Fly away!!

I want to really find my reason to shine
In that case "Everything I've done 'till now" I'll have to leave it
Come on! Come on! Come on!
It's fine if crazy!
I want you to find your reason to shine
If that's the case then share your thoughts with everyone
Being what you want to do give it all from you　Yeah, right?　Yes, it is!

Everyone here　we love you!
Everyone here　we love you!

The times I put my words into a song like this
I pour all my feelings on it　don't ever forget it!

Thrilled and full of joy let's all do it
If we dance we will come as on around the world
Come on! Come on! Come on!
Let's get together
Thrilled and full of emotion you should do it
Let your heart dance along and connect wit everyone
This is something lovely we'll never stop to do　Yeah, that's right!

Nonstop nonstop the music
Nonstop nonstop the hopping heart/nLet's decide what to do next
I want to play with you, to smile with you

I feel like when we're together, we can do anything!
After all, just being here proves that
Now let's go beyond this dream we've realized
And find a new dream
I can see it in your eyes
Aah, you're waiting for excitement
Of course, we are too!

So come along, so come along
You'll be left behind if you don't hurry
It's a journey to a fun world, Yay!
Everyone come along, do come along!
It'll be lively if we're all together
With our power and your heart, let's face tomorrow

We got here through hard work and be listening to your voice
Responding "Don't succumb, you can't lose!"
We want to give shape to all kinds of dreams
Let's search for them
You're here
Ahh, the future is warm
Since you'll be with us always!

Forever, Forever
These bonds are unbreakable
We run with the same thoughts, Yay!
Everyone forever, Forever
Look at this eternal dream
With our power and your heart, it's a parade!

We're happy, we want to say it after all
Yay yay, thank you always
Shall we start something again?
Let's do it, we want to begin, everyone together!

Forever, forever
With these unbreakable bonds
Seems everyone's shouting
Yeah Hop, Step, Yay!

So come along, so come along
You'll be left behind if you don't hurry
Everyone come along, do come along!
It'll be lively if we're all together
With our power and your heart, let's face tomorrow
Hooray! Yay!/nIf I can’t decide even though I want to,
I will consult you

Which clothes would suit me better?
Would others see it the same way?
Furthermore I’m not sure of my own criteria
At times like those, you called me over, My friend

The answer is probably the two of us
Laughing off the doubts of our wavering hearts
I really, I really love you

Humming day  What shall we do?
Humming day  Anything is fine
For example, something even bigger? That's the feeling I have
Humming day  A fun future
Humming day  Going to search but
You're worried, so I held your hand with a nod


These dishonest feelings will surely
Be noticed one way or another
In the end, I can’t lie to myself
At times like those, you told me to be strong, my friend

I hid it but the truth is
You sensed my tearful feelings
I really, I really love you
...We may fight, but

Hello sky  After the fight
Hello sky  We became closer
We managed to apologize somehow without words
Hello sky  A fun world
Hello sky  Let's discover lots more
I want to make it interesting, Humming my friend

If I can’t decide even though I want to,
I will consult you


Humming day  What shall we do?
Humming day  Anything is fine
There are a lot of answers  But also hesitation
Humming day  What shall we do?
Humming day  Anything is fine
For example, something even bigger? That's the feeling I have
Humming day  A fun future
Humming day  Going to search but
You're worried, so I held your hand with a nod

If I can’t decide even though I want to,
I will... consult you!/nPeople aren't limited to only one existence
white wing black wing
A different me from yesterday gives a different answer today
If no is yes, then yes is no? It all depends on my mood
Ah, I'm certain there's more "me's" that I have yet to know

To cross this boring world
We have to combine our powers
Look, if it's me and you and "me", a miracle will soon happen!
But right now we have to bear with it, we have to bide our time in this unstable world


People believe that they are people through memories
good deed bad deed
I hate that my true form is different from everyone else's
"Go" means "go", not "stop", if you take the plunge without hesitation
You'll fly on nonstop, so take the plunge without hesitation
Ah, I've truly understood the real me

Do you still dream of the sacred world?
Beauty is something fragile
Maybe you and "you" and all of us can no longer remain innocent

Do you dream of the sacred world?
Do you want white wings upon your back?
But you and "you" and all of us can no longer remain innocent

To cross this boring world
We have to combine our powers
Look if it's me and you and "me", a miracle will soon happen!
But right now we have to bear with it, we have to bide our time and wait for our chance
Someday, somewhere, you and I are bound to meet in this unstable world/n"I can't be loved by anyone"
Don't say that, even if you want to

Hey, surely we're really similar
So don't close off your heart
Hey, surely our feelings are the same
(I want to love only one)
Just one love is enough

Till that time, I'll shut myself away
In the inside of a small egg

Open eyes! Before long I'll wake up
And soon, I'll break open this shell
Open eyes! Though I'm cowardly, I want to fly
But I'm trembling in my innocence

Love me, say yes? Say yes!

Feelings without substance change me (So)
Is this what passion is?
It doesn't happen many times, right? Only once
After all, that's what fate is.

But until then, we shut ourselves away
You're also inside an egg, aren't you?

Open heart! My chest aches with a throbbing pain
How can I unfurl these wet wings?
Open heart! I want to love, and to be loved
But I'm afraid and innocent

Love me do!

It shouldn't be many times Love me do!
Open heart! My chest aches with a throbbing pain
How can I unfurl these wet wings?
Open heart! I want to love, and to be loved
True love happens only once, says my innocence

Love me! Say yes!/nIt’s a mystery, but nevertheless a coincidence
That in this place, we met at the stream of fate
It’s a mystery, it finally changes
I want to see the course of the passing time up until the very end

I can’t ask “for whose sake do I embark on this journey?”
Surely (surely) within your eyes (within your eyes)
Ah! Do you hold the answer?
“For whose sake do I embark on this journey?” I’ll smile
I can’t ask that. Do you understand?

It’s important, right? However, all of a sudden
We are talking about the love born from the heart
It’s important, right? Tell me softly
About this ritual to confirm our love

I can’t say “I will be filled with happiness forever”
Always (always) day after day (day after day)
Ah! It should pile up, right?
“I will be filled with happiness forever” I’ll smile
I can’t say that even if I wish for it

While having fun, and while watching over you (it was exhilarating)
Finally that day comes, it is each and every tomorrow

I can’t ask “for whose sake do I embark on this journey?”
Surely (surely) within your eyes (within your eyes)
Ah! Do you hold the answer?
“For whose sake do I embark on this journey?” I’ll smile
I can’t ask that. Do you understand?
There’s no way I can say farewell/nI wonder what kind of summer lies in store for us 
On the edge of this sea that stretches out for miles?
One day I'll like to find out, though I already have a feeling
That we'll have the most fun right here

It's not special or anything, but this sea 
Has always watched over us
And this old beach knows
Our joys and our sadness

The morning is still cold
And our feet are freezing
In the water fish brush by our feet
This is kind of fun

Let's spend our summer here together
The voice of the waves rolling on the shore gives the feeling of vacation
I want to hear it together, it's so refreshing, right?
We have to take a break sometimes

Let's have a chat
While crunching the sand beneath our feet
Our summer life in our very own home town

I had a small yearning
For a walk while holding a white parasol
Let's walk, not minding our sunburns
On our beach that's number one!

I want to make the beauty of the sunset into a postcard
I'm fascinated by the changing gradations
So pretty, and heartrending

Let's spend next summer here together too
When you can't think of a place you want to go
Come over here! A summer not doing anything is fine too, right?
Before the heat makes our heads dizzy

Let's spend our summer here together
The voice of the waves rolling on the shore gives the feeling of vacation
I want to hear it together, it's so refreshing, right?
We have to take a break sometimes

Let's have a chat
While crunching the sand beneath our feet
Our summer life in our very own home town
The sky is sparkling
Even if I close my eyes, the shore that I love is dazzling
Our local love filled summer life/nI can't wait to see the smiles this year
Let's go search for presents in the city

When the door decorated with a silver ribbon opened
You were there--we had the same idea

We were found out (by each other) and start to laugh
Tell me what you want
I'm happy (I'm happy) we all get along
Sharing the happy feelings

Yeah! Happy Christmas!!

Because what's important is spending time with you always,
It's a promise, save some time for me
Gather your courage and call this out
I wish merry merry Christmas！
Now, call out everybody, don't you want to party?
Cheers to jingle bells!

It's a special day, shall we make a big cake?
A feeling that it'll be a failure, you can't speak of that!

Snow (it better fall) I get it, but
I hope for something romantic
Let's play (let's play) even if we make too much noise, since it's this day
We'll be forgiven

Yeah! Dancin' Christmas!!

Who is it that you want to see? If you want to be with them
Let's go invite them, we'll have fun dancing
We'll frolic around, while clinging to each other
I wish merry merry Christmas!
So, everyone's plans, I want to decide them on this night
The jingle bells won't stop

Because what's important is spending time with you always,
It's a promise, save some time for me
Gather your courage and call this out!
Who is it that you want to see? If you want to be with them
Let's go invite them, we'll have fun dancing
We'll frolic around, while clinging to each other
I wish merry merry Christmas!
So, everyone's plans, I want to decide them on this night
The jingle bells won't stop/nBelieve in it... the moment when your heart was throbbing
Believe in it... your pure love lens is right

Get closer, *thump thump* charge forward!
With my rule, *thump thump* charge forward!

What's the problem? Are you having an unrequited love?
Why don't I help you out with this wondrous power

What's your real intention? Is it no good unless it's him?
Then close your eyes, and gently whisper his name

Let us pray for your sake
For your feelings to be granted as high as possible

Believe in it... the moment when your heart was throbbing
Because you see, encounters aren't by choice but coincidences
Believe in it... I was cut by your pure love lens
His dazzling smile is the best
I can feel the strength of your feelings... I'll cheer for you!

Get closer, *ton ton* charge forward
With my rule, *ton ton* Let's go
Get closer, *ton ton* charge forward
If you like him, put in effort to get closer!

I can counsel you too, you know? You cried because of your first love?
I will encourage you with this special power

Is this really okay? You wish to forget all about him?
Open your eyes, and let out your wish once more

Receive this formless power,
The power to achieve victory from here on

Waiting... But just this is an unmoving love
No matter which you choose, the situation will change right?
Waiting... Rather than that, wouldn't you take the leap
You've succeeded in gaining his attention
To convey the strength of your feelings... Let's practice that!

Take a photo *pa pa pa pachin*
With my lens *pa pa pa* Let's go
Take a photo *pa pa pa pachin*
I want your pure love to bear fruit!

Believe in it... this moment when your heart is throbbing
Believe in it... your pure love lens is right
Believe in it... this moment when your heart is throbbing
Because you see, encounters aren't by choice but coincidences
Believe in it... I was cut by your pure love lens
His dazzling smile is the best
I can feel the strength of your feelings... I'll cheer for you!

Get closer, *ton ton* charge forward
With my rule, *ton ton* Let's go
Get closer, *ton ton* charge forward
If you like him, put in effort to get closer!/nCome! Come! Dance again seductively
Come on, come! To Kaguya’s castle
Our fateful encounter is a manipulative mystery
A perilous persona

Let’s dance! Let’s dance! The Dance beat won’t end
Come on dance, let’s dance! At Kaguya’s castle
Laser beams pierce the night sky
Will you watch with me?

The dazzling stars illuminate these feelings
Oh dream, last forever
I want to forget all about tomorrow

I’m the princess of red roses, I want you to make me yours tenderly
I gently whisper and meaningfully avert my eyes
You’re the knight of the white moon, The hand I felt is still warm
Don’t let go and hold me tight
I call this miracle love

Come! Come! Dance again with passion
Come on, come! To Kaguya’s castle
The energy engulfs any hesitation
Passion doesn’t sleep

Let’s dance! Let’s dance! The Dance beat won’t stop
Come on dance, let’s dance! At Kaguya’s castle
The discothèque intertwines the constellations
Stir me up too

My heart vows upon the twinkling stars
A transient dream is fine
Tomorrow will take care of itself

I’m the princess of black roses, I want you to make me yours passionately
So I smile and my eyes invite you to chase me
You’re also the knight of the black moon, Warmth lies deep in your eyes
Seize me and hold me tight
This miracle is called love

I’m the princess of red roses, I want you to make me yours tenderly
I gently whisper and meaningfully avert my eyes
You’re the knight of the white moon, The hand I felt is still warm
Don’t let go and hold me tight
I call this miracle love/nI was waiting for you on the coastal street, but today you just wouldn't show up
I was waiting for you on the coastal street, but your car kept on going past me

I don't know which of us started this first
But on this street (that we always) go home on, we were both put in a bad mood

When you think about it, we got distant over such stupid things
With those accidentally strong (and harsh) words, we've started an angry competition

But still
I'd really thought you'd understand me

I was waiting for you on the coastal street, but today you just wouldn't show up

I'm so anxious about tomorrow, when we have to see each other
I don't have any confidence that I'll be able (to smile) at you normally
I'll probably have to act from now on that it was only coincidence
That I (casually) walk over to you just to see how things are going...
I hate this
These salty feelings of mine are getting me down
Ugh, I hate this!

As I walk, the sea and the wind become orange-coloured
My selfish thoughts begin to shine, and give me motivation

So, I'm telling you
I'm waiting for you on the coastal street, I shout it out to the sunset
I'm waiting for you on the coastal street, I want you to know I'm still waiting!
This costal street (we always use) is the seaside of our friendship (so)
I really want you to come today
Will you come? Will you not? Won't you? Please come!/nBoredom… There’s no time to feel it
Hold down the mystery and show me
From such whispers, it falls
An innocent heart, ah how lovely

And it is stained by uncertainty
The people with broken-like wings
Love, dreams and the like are loved, throw them away already
(Boredom… One day)

It would be nice if you became strong in front of me (become strong)
 Even while you’re getting hurt, crawl back up (shivering)
From that momentary pleasure, I approach eternity
Now, at the unknown words, I make an overflowing oath

Run past uncertainty
You can betray the spirit of imprisonment
Even if you shout, even if you turn around, it’s just your own shadow
Even so, run past the darkness
Stroke the betrayed sincerity
I think I can still make it in time
Now, let’s go and oppose it

For the sake of not getting fooled anymore
The people who spread their wings
Love, the beloved illusions, erase them right now
(Boredom… One day)

I will probably remain in depression (become depressed)
I wait for the moment while being ridiculed (I’m running out of patience)
As for the gentleman-like pact, it has nothing to do with ladies
Now, at the truthful words, I smash that fake smile

Destiny will change
A repainted new world
Blooms from the lovely splendor, I want to see it for myself
Destiny will change proudly
If you fall like a flower, you will be red
Just being fired up is not bad too
Now, let’s have some fun

Boredom… "Come towards the sleep to end it all" it invites me
That is surely fine when it's calm, right?
Day after day until it becomes so

Run past uncertainty
You can betray the spirit of imprisonment
Even if you shout, even if you turn around, it’s just your own shadow
Even so, run past the darkness
Stroke the betrayed sincerity
I think I can still make it in time
Now, let’s go and oppose it

Now, let’s go and oppose it/nEverything is from God’s will… it’s a revolution, isn't it? God!

Grant the wishes, Bless the world (Hi)
Base it off the wishes, Go the world (Hi)
Defend the wishes, Kiss the world (Hi)
(Hi Hi Hi)

The form of happiness is unknown to everyone
The miracle to find everyone’s happiness

It’s tough work
I want to be of help
We are one hundred percent serious!

From the darkness, there is a twinkling bright smile
During the truly painful times, please shout out
“Our strong, strong bonds!”

That kind of God, using dreams to show the way
Will always support us
Probably, in the future, for all eternity, right?
This seems like an era where nothing will be lost
Therefore now is the time, I have to do this
This is not an absolute fate
Grant the wishes, Bless the world (Hi)
Base it off the wishes, Go the world (Hi)

The course of love for each person is a mystery
The awareness to develop everyone’s love

Challenges are work too
It's not enough to say “I have to help”
We will cheer with all we've got!

If we’re likely to be engulfed by the sinister waves
Firmly seize it and please shout out
“Our strong, strong feelings!”

If I move forward with that kind of God
Surely tomorrow will be
All up to me to make well, right?
In the case where everything is precious
It would be nice if we could close off the vault in the heart
This is not a comforting fate
Grant the wishes, Bless the world (Hi)
Defend the wishes, Kiss the world (Hi)

“A strong, strong me?”

That kind of God, using dreams to show the way
Will always support us
Probably, in the future, for all eternity, right?
This seems like an era where nothing will be lost
Therefore now is the time, I have to do this
This is not an absolute fate
Grant the wishes, Bless the world (Hi)
Base it off the wishes, Go the world (Hi)
Defend the wishes, Kiss the world (Hi Hi Hi)/nHand in Hand, wow wo! Hand in Hand, wow wo!

What am I looking for?
I still don’t know, but I think the entrance is here (Hand in Hand)
The sleeping passion inside you
It’s going to awake soon… I feel it! (Hand in Hand)

The premonition that gives birth to the dream
Shouldn’t be a mere illusion (wow wo!)
It won’t start until you move
I want to grab hold of that hand

Change, Change, from today to a new world
Change, Change, I’ll try to push you forward with energy
If we’re together, maybe we will fly
I won’t hesitate or give up anymore
I’ve decided! Where will we go from now on?
Let’s go, hand in hand!

Who are we going to reunite with?
Maybe it’s not the right time (Hand in Hand)
I want to believe in my intuition, my heart shivers as I end up wanting to call out

If you don’t want your dreams to be shapeless
You’re not alone (wow wo!)
You’ll end up wanting companions
Who also want to act, like you

“Come over, come over,” I know it’s an unreasonable request, but I must invite you still
“Come over, come over,” If you get your courage out, you can probably do it
I want to fly somewhere together
So, give me your hand, and let’s go!

Hand in Hand, wow wo!

The premonition that gives birth to the dream
Shouldn’t be a mere illusion, wow wo!

Change, Change, from today to a new world

Let’s solve this mystery and those that follow; let’s play in this world!
Escape and Search on mind

There’s no advancing if I can’t close off this wish, so don’t be shy and listen to me 
If we’re together, I’m sure we’ll understand
These clues we can’t see alone

A voice that seems to light up the darkness, 
I’ll try using it to call out to you
If I believe it’ll definitely reach you, then with this seemingly miraculous light,

The two of us will see each other, right?
My heart is getting all fired up!

I’m looking at you; reflect my gaze in your eyes
With the words, “Search for it,” my heart wants to give out a strong beat
So that this mystery can change into something more exciting
Escape and Search on mind

The moment I wished for this game to start,
The moment I wished for a dazzling future,
You can call it an adventure—it’s a bit like love
Like a never-ending jet coaster that won’t stop now

This darkness is a real thing; 
I think it’s gonna rise to the surface
I’ll believe it will definitely reach you. This seemingly miraculous light is

Inviting us closer to the answer
It’s something instinctive that makes us feel
Even… hotter!

A mystery always opens up a new place right before your eyes
I’m waiting for you to say, “I’ve found it,” so hurry up and search for it
Let’s solve this mystery and those that follow; let’s play in this world!

There’s a ton of things we still don’t know—
Ah, even so, let’s keep moving forward
Because nothing will change unless we make sense of it ourselves

Once you solve the mystery,
You’ll find that you’re not alone

I’m looking at you; reflect my gaze in your eyes
With the words, “Search for it,” my heart wants to give out a strong beat
So that this mystery can change into something more exciting, let’s play!
Escape and Search on mind/nRight now...
We want, to try changing the future!
After all, we've only just started to notice our dreams

For a trigger, anything will do, so
Let's search for excitement together (Heave-ho! Excitement alright)
If it's something you truly wish for
Try proving that you can make it come true

Where can someone as small and insignificant as myself end up flying to?
And I keep telling myself, "I don't know, I just don't know!"
(We'll make it somehow) Ah! Let's start

Is your heart shining?
If you can hear your heart, then answer "Yes!!"
I wonder if this encounter will be able to change everyone?
The sun is shining on our dreams today as well

(Oh yes, Doki-Doki Sunshine Oh yes, Doki-Doki Sunshine)

I'm really bad with dealing with boredom
Let's go all out when playing, ok? (Got it! Going all out, alright)
Even during the times when we're lost
Take firm steps and dash towards our goal with all we've got

If you give up just because it didn't go well
You'll definitely regret it later (...that's right)
That's why, even if it's unreasonable, I want to try even if I don't know what will come afterwards
I just don't know, but it seems interesting
(We might be able to make it somehow) Come on, over here!

Just how many times are you able to get back on your feet?
Put your hand on your heart: it'll laugh out "Yes!!"
I still don't know the meaning behind this encounter, but
Even though we don't know, our dreams we has awakened are still bright

(Oh yes, Doki-Doki Sunshine Oh yes, Doki-Doki Sunshine)

Is your heart shining?
If you can hear your heart, then answer "Yes!!"
I wonder if this encounter will be able to change everyone?
The sun is shining on our dreams today as well
Just how many times are you able to get back on your feet?

Even though we don't know
Our dreams are still bright (Oh yes, Doki-Doki Sunshine)
We've awakened now (Oh yes, Doki-Doki Sunshine)

Right now...
We might, have started to change our future!
That's right, we've only just started to notice our dreams/nNO! I know you, you know me
I say "We are friends!!"

When we were little kids
You were always the crybaby
But before I knew it, our roles had reversed
It's frustrating, hmph!

It's always been just the two of us
But for some reason your face looks so mature at times
Even though it's just you, my heart is swaying!
That's wrong! NO NO NO NO NO!!

Huh? We're just friends
My heart shouldn't be throbbing like this
Huh? We're childhood friends
So there's no way I'd fall in love with you!

I smack your back jokingly
But quickly feel flustered at how broad it is
Where did your brattiness go?
Now I feel lonely, hmph!

It doesn't seem like you have a girlfriend
And I don't think you'll get one
But in spite of that, today you brought a girl with you!
That's mean! NO NO NO NO NO!!

Huh? We're just friends
I shouldn't be feeling jealous like this
Huh? We're childhood friends
But I think I'm in love; what should I do!?

Huh? We're just friends
My heart shouldn't be throbbing like this
Huh? We're childhood friends
So there's no way I'd fall in love with you!
Huh? We're just friends
I shouldn't be feeling jealous like this
Huh? We're childhood friends
But I think I'm in love; what should I do!?

NO! I know you, you know me
I say "We are friends!!"
NO! I know you, you know me
You say? "We are friends!!"/nYour eyes only follow one single person
Despite there being a lot of others around, they follow only one
You understand this love now, right?
You don't have to hide it
I'll cheer for you with all my might

Do they live nearby? (What kind of person are they?)
My heart is beating too!
You have to confess with the right timing, right?
Hey, hurry! Hey, hurry! When will the chance come?

So it will surely be conveyed (A Happy End of mutual love!)
Because I want to see you laughing happily
It will surely be conveyed!
I hope the future I wish for isn't far away, either
But that's a bonus
What's important right now
Is for this love of yours to be realized, no matter what!

"Just the two of us", my heart's going to burst
Just by imagining it, I get scared
If I ever fall into this kind of love
You'd be the first one I'll tell

What do you do next? (Get closer!)
My heart is fluttering.
Confess with only a yes
Hey, hurry! Hey, hurry! Just go for it!

You've always longed for it (A fated Happy End!)
So go and be happy! Enough to annoy me
What you've always been longing for
Saying it sure is embarrassing...Love is wonderful, isn't it?

Aah, when will that day come for me?
The love that you embrace is so dear

Where will "I like you" come from? (Before you realize it?)
My heart is fluttering and beating
You have to confess with the right timing, right?
Hey, hurry! Hey, hurry! When will the chance come?

So it will surely be conveyed (A Happy End of mutual love!)
Because I want to see you laughing happily
It will surely be conveyed
I hope the future I wish for isn't far away, either
But that's a bonus
What's important right now is for your love to be realized, no matter what!/nWhat kind of future awaits us? While wondering that
(I have been) We all have been slowly fumbling along our way

Encouraging one another, and even when we clashed
(We knew) We shared the same dream

What we aim for is that sun
To capture that great brilliance
We're getting closer to fulfilling our wishes
Let's sing our Sensations within the light!

The miracle is right here and now
Everyone's feelings led them to this place
That's why, we'll enjoy this moment
The story that we will bring to life together, the Story of our dreams
"It's dazzling!" "It's great!" "Come over here!"
"I'm happy!" "It's great!" "Come closer!"
Our hearts become one... and sparkle!!


Once again today, I am grateful for all the support
(With you) I want to talk with all of you, that's the peak of joy

It can't be expressed with words alone; What should we do?
(At times like these) Let's sing, we have to sing

One by one, we leap forward
To capture this moment that won't come twice
Do you still remember the wishes you once made?
Let's dance our Sensations within the light!

With you I've made it here, up to this point
Everyone's feelings reached us, thank you
Finally we made it here together, so let's enjoy ourselves
The story that we will bring to life together, our earnest Story
"It's dazzling!" "It's great!" "Over here!"
"I'm happy!" "It's great!" "Come closer!"
Our unending dream is
Sparkling... Sparkling!!!

Hi! Hi! Our dream is never ending!


One by one, we leap forward
To capture this moment that won't come twice
Do you still remember the wishes you once made?
Let's dance our Sensations within the light!

With you I've made it here, up to this point

Our hearts become one... and sparkle!!/nBefore we knew it
We've come so far
Ah, the sky is as blue as ever

Our desire to obtain something
When we had nothing
Ah, is that what paved the way for us?

I learned that a miracle would happen
I wish I could tell that to ourselves back then

That not giving up is the key to your dreams
Is it okay if I say it now? I want to say it

Our hearts shake in hesitation, yet face ahead
No rain lasts forever, We ran all the way here
If we just look up, there will be the warm sun

From one person to two,
And from two to everyone, it was handed down
Ah, the beat of our dreams

Even though we had nothing
We felt like we could achieve something
Ah, maybe it was too daring, but we persisted

A miracle happened (A miracle) it really did
I want to tell that to our worried selves

In times when we want to throw it all away, and times we have to make big changes
Surely the chances will be there, They were there
You can't search for a miracle without moving, Even if you take a break never stop
Knowing every night will dawn, we ran all the way here
There will always be the warm sun

If we sing about our future, our courage, our light
Even if our words are awkward, they'll reach
So, let's use a loud voice!

Not giving up is the key to your dreams
Is it okay if I say it now? I want to say it

Our hearts shake in hesitation, yet face ahead
No rain lasts forever, We ran all the way here
If we just look up, there will be the warm sun

You can't search for a miracle without moving, Even if you take a break never stop
In the dawning night sky...is the warm sun!/nChase it honestly, chase it with courage
A small wish will create tomorrow
It’s possible if everyone wants it

Try harder than anyone, maintain your passion
Our aim is the beautiful path where the wind blows

Raise your arms as if they were wings
And fly to the dazzling future

I’m sure I can hear the sounds of youth, it can be heard in that moment
When you smile, everyday will be okay!
I’m sure I can hear the sounds of youth, I want to see that moment
Stay by my side (What a pleasant sight)
And I’ll be by yours

I want to see you honestly, I want to see you energetically
Under the glistening rays of the sun streaming down
What we talk about is everyone’s future

Someone said that things will come true of we believe in ourselves
Perhaps I understand that miracles should be grasped

Take in the frustration
And journey to the world you envision

Finally youth is budding, I want to give you this pleasant feeling
Wherever you are, stretch out proudly
Finally youth is budding, I love this pleasant feeling
You’re really here (It’s always lovely)
And I’m really here for you

I’m sure I can hear the sounds of youth, it can be heard in that moment
When you smile, everyday will be okay!
I’m sure I can hear the sounds of youth, I want to see that moment
Stay by my side (What a pleasant sight)
And I’ll be by yours/nMy heart beats faster when I think about you
I'm burning up!

"You seem more tired than usual"
I quietly say from behind you

Can't you hear me?
My heart is speaking to you
Even though we're in the same classroom, you're too far away

Maybe I'm bothering you just by looking at you?
A sigh slips through my lips as I murmur to myself

This lonely heaven won't come to an end
I can't tell you to notice my feelings
Because I'm afraid of heartbreak
This love mustn't disappear
This is my lonely heaven
Painful yet affectionate
My heart beats faster when I think about you
I can't stop this burning passion!

After school, I spot you at the bus stop
You look like you're waiting for someone, but who?

Is she from our class? Or the class next door?
I want to know, but it hurts

What I want to say is really just a silly dream
I won't hope for anything more than this; my love can stay unrequited

I want to embrace my heaven
I won't seek anything more
I'll accept this heartache
Love is meant to be cried over, right?
Don't take away my heaven
Though it's small and fleeting
My heart beats faster when I think about you
I'm burning up; I want to hold you!

This lonely heaven won't come to an end
I can't tell you to notice my feelings
Because I'm afraid of heartbreak
This love mustn't disappear
This is my lonely heaven
Painful yet affectionate
My heart beats faster when I think about you
I can't stop this burning passion! This passionate heaven/n"Sweet words are unnecessary"
That's a lie... The truth is I've been waiting forever
It's a fleeting silhouette of hope
While suffering the pain, I withdraw into myself

I already wanted to give up, and just simply be friends
And even though no one asked
My loneliness broke off all conversation

That's just unkind. But to you,
who wanted to appear kind
You helped me with my hopeless wish
But you know, there's a danger that someday all this could fall apart
And to continue on pretending not to see that, I'm starting to become afraid

Strong emotions are more powerful than happiness
Why is it... like a poison, it can't be stopped
Just like the taboo of a forbidden game
Maybe it's simply something like a bad dream

And without reward, I keep on repeating it
It's just as you told me, isn't it
The loneliness keeps piercing through me

I want to be loved by you, but you
are in love with someone else
My steady pure heart won't change
That's why that "someday" won't come
Because we aren't tied together
Let's continue pretending not to see it, just like now...

And without reward, I keep on repeating it
It's just as you told me, isn't it
The loneliness keeps piercing through me

I want to be loved by you, but you
are in love with someone else
My steady pure heart won't change
That's why I turned my back
I can't say it, I can't think it
Anyway, time is what I want, to be right here/nOpen the sky-colored curtains! Welcome through the sea-colored gates!
Let's play!

Swaying and shaking, the clock of pearl
Is luring the two of us into a dream
Let's make merry within the aquarium, splashing about
You've been invited to the fishes' party

How is it that we can breathe underwater?
Maybe it's because of the hot tea we drank earlier?
Well, such trivial things, there's no need to mind them
Shall we enjoy the fishes' party?

This seems like lots and lots of fun (Floating)
If that's the case, then if we float together
I'll become different from how I usually am
I want to approach you, so close that I can hear your sighs; I miss you!

In the aquarium, (Yeah!) a fantasy of our encounter
It's surprisingly heart-throbbing, that's the magic of love (Fantastic love!)
In the aquarium, (Yeah!) notice it, what I've hidden at the back of my chest
My true feelings, I'll try being honest from here onwards
I won't hide my love anymore (No!)

After all in the water you can go anywhere
We can swim well from the depths to the surface, wow!
Is the water shallow? Is our youth deep?
No matter what, the fishes know everything

Enjoy yourself properly (Bubbly)
At the end, let's ride the bubbles together
We'll meet again right, how about a kiss
If you kiss me? Do you want to kiss me? Don't kiss me!
Just here and now, and only you, I love you! (I love you!)

If it's the marine blue (Yeah!) The two of us is a dream symphony
It'll definitely be played, it's a sweet miracle of love (Fantastic eyes)
If it's the marine blue (Yeah!) I won't be afraid even though it's my first time
I'll be my true self, and try being bold next time onwards
I won't hide my love anymore (No!)

You're invited Wow wo! To the aquarium
You're invited Wow wo! I want to be in love
(Fantastic!) Let's play


Floating and bubbling, I want to look you in the eyes and say
I love you Wow wo!

In the aquarium, a fantasy of our encounter
It's surprisingly heart-throbbing, that's the magic of love
In the aquarium, (Yeah!) notice it, what I've hidden at the back of my chest
My true feelings, I'll be honest and try being bold from here onwards
I won't hide my love anymore (No!)

(Fantastic love Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!)/nHere's my small signal, rin-rin-ring a bell
If you can hear, please nod and answer!

Please let my ability to find mysterious awaken
I want to feel excited every day
But not because of you...you've got it all wrong!
I'm in a strange mood, it feels like all excuses

I end up calling out to you after all
and laugh as always
Just a little (just a little), my heartbeat's (faster than normal)
Why's my heart racing? Why?

I want to get started now, rin-rin-ring a bell
That's weird...but it's not love, sheesh!
Here's my small signal, rin-rin-ring a bell
You pretended to not hear, but I kept on ringing

Whenever I feel cramped, I take a walk
My step suddenly feels so light
You're not here, are you? Yeah, you definitely aren't! 
What if we met by coincidence? How'd I feel?

I don't want you to feel down
But I'm not interested - it's written all over your face
The truth is (the truth is), having expectations (hurts!)
Can I just dream? Can I?

I wanna make sure, ren-ren-rendezvous
It's so fun...isn't this love?
In my heart, a colorful ren-ren-rendezvous
My reddening cheeks are too honest!

I want to get started now, rin-rin-ring a bell
That's weird...is it completely strange?
Here's my small signal, rin-rin-ring a bell
You pretended to not hear, but I kept on ringing
Give me your answer, please!/nIt’s dyed by the sunset
This somewhat lonely scene
 The usual chitchat goes on
I feel that “normal is the best”

“Don’t ever change!”
I wonder if that is selfish of me
“Be nice to no one but me”
Just kidding… that was just a joke

“Welcome back, how was it?”
I’ll try talking about today’s various things
“Don’t be worried, okay?”
Because I don’t want you to suddenly disappear
“Welcome back, was it fun?”
I’m in the mood to hear today’s funny stories
“The wind is a bit chilly today, isn't it?”
Let’s prepare some things to keep us warm!

So hey... therefore, so hey... probably
I will wait for you right here

One by one, the shining stars
Bring with them the uneasiness of times like this
I want to brush it all off
But I unconsciously let the cold words overflow

“You won’t ever change, right?”
I will start wanting to push all my concerns onto you
I’m full of uneasiness
Somehow… I feel it even from a distant place

I send you off with both hands quivering
But then I realized how high you've risen
Because looking at your retreating figure
You turn around and wave goodbye one more time

“Welcome back, how was it?”
I’ll try talking about today’s various things
“I’m worried, I really am”
Because I don’t want you to suddenly disappear
“Hey, did you encounter anything fun?”
If so, show me and make me laugh
“The wind is a bit chilly today”
Let’s prepare some things to keep us warm!

I will always be waiting here
“Welcome back!”/nHey, could I tell you something?
about myself...

My heart is aflutter because I might be able to see you today
I want to skip down the path
And dance in this moment

You probably never pay any attention to me
But... I'm here
I'm right here

My confidence is wavering... What if you don't like me?
Anyway, I need to greet you energetically!

The sun's finally out in full strength
I can feel my energy rising
Instead of saying "Good morning," I tap you on the back
And say "Come on, let's go!"
If the sun's finally out in full strength
I'll surely be smiling happily
But for some reason, my heart is hurting now

I space out during class and stare far, far away
Isn't love supposed to be sweet?
That's not right; it's half bitter

Instead of just dreaming, I want to feel it for myself to make sure
That's why... I'll make my move
Sounds like what I'd do, right?

I love my life; every day is like a miracle
So it goes without saying that I'll be courageous instead of regretting!

I've always, always been waiting to hear it from you
But now I'll say it first:
"I love you!"
I've always, always been waiting
So won't you answer me?
Show me your complete feelings

I love my life; every day is like a miracle
I'm actually scared on the inside, but I'll be brave!

I've always, always been waiting to hear it from you
But now I'll say it first:
"I love you!"
I've always, always been waiting
So won't you answer me?
Show me your complete feelings/nI'm waiting just like always
I'm waiting at that place
Though we didn't make a promise, I'm certain it will reach you

If I'm waiting just like always
If I'm waiting at that place
You'll come over with a smile, excited and short of breath 

While thinking that there's always later, every day is flowing past
I want to treasure the present at least; We can't return to this moment

The seasons are passing by, everything changes
It's natural, yet my heart feels slightly lonely
Your feelings, just how far would you go chasing them?
We've come so far since when we first met and decided to be together
Ah, surely you... feel the same...?

We can meet just like always, right? (With everyone)
Because we can meet at that place (It's alright)
With a smile, we can overcome the future (the future)

The sky at the end of each day illuminates us
The evening sky beneath which we talked about tomorrow is extremely nostalgic

Holding on to our wishes (our wishes), spinning the threads of our dream (sparkling)
It's wonderful; See, your heart is searching for the next (the next) story
The light (the light), just how far would you go chasing it? (How far)
Seeing this together, the radiance we decided on, has become the gem of my heart (of me)
Ah, surely you... feel the same...!


The seasons are passing by, everything changes (that's right)
It's natural, yet my heart feels slightly (slightly) lonely
Your feelings (your feelings), just how far would you go chasing them? (How far)
We've come so far since when we first met and decided to be together
Ah, surely everyone... feels the same...!/nIf we combine our feelings together
Perhaps we can manage somehow or another
Our power is tiny but
We have dreams that we want to nurture

There's so much we don't comprehend
There's nothing like road maps in our pockets
It'll be okay even if we just progress bit by bit
Let's stick our chests out proudly and push forward

What will you do when you mess up?
Why not try smiling? With a smile, shout "Yay, yay, yay!"
We'll be fine singing with genuine and honest voices
One, two, three, four
Everyone, over here!

Someday, our wishes will come true one day
Someday, let's have faith that they'll make it one day
There's no point in crying like that, after all
The fun has only just, only just begun!

The worries are never-ending
Even if we look back and sigh
We'll cheer each other on
I'm glad we're together again today

Teaching and being taught
It's so pleasant, our friendship increases
When we can't help but fight
We'll spring back and apologize

Nod impressively!
Try smiling! With a smile, shout "Hi, hi, hi!"
We'll be fine even though we make mistakes
One, two, three, four
As expected, over there!

Something, now there's something in your direction
Something, now there's something with a lovely feeling
That's what I feel like telling you, so just wait a bit
There's much more, much more fun to come!

What will you do when you mess up?
Why not try smiling? With a smile, shout "Yay, yay, yay!"
We'll be fine singing with genuine and honest voices
One, two, three, four
Everyone, over here!

Someday, our wishes will come true one day
Someday, let's have faith that they'll make it one day
There's no point in crying like that, after all
The fun has only just, only just begun!/nEveryone advised me to do it, so I did it
I became student council president!

My mom also went to Otonokizaka High,
And I share love for it

Things got serious for a while
And our school was nearly closed down!

I met everyone here, I met µ's here
And working together, we've managed to make it this far
We sing for today, facing the future
And we watch as the world slowly starts to spin around!

Yes!/nYou're fragile
You're fragile

You're always scared while giving a smile
I understand the feeling of not wanting to be hated
That's why you won't say anything of the truth
You swallow a single breath and endure it

Just stop it already and show your heart only to me
I love your eyes that are about to cry
And your defenseless, clumsy way of living too

If we don't protect these fragile things, they will be broken
I will always protect you, I will hold you tight

You're fragile

The hesitation you convey makes my chest hurt
Some people just don't know what such kindness is
But then I discover the truth
When we got together, you don't have to endure anymore

Right now, show your grief only to me
I like that you think too much
The complete opposite of me

Don't break these fragile, fleeting feelings
I will always protect you, I will hold you tight

Your heart is already injured from being afraid of getting hurt
Were you waiting for me? I found your Real heart

If we don't protect these fragile things, they will be broken
I will always protect you, I will hold you tight
Don't break these fragile, fleeting feelings
I will always protect you, I will hold you tight
Fragile love, fragile things

You're fragile
Fragile love
You're fragile/nI want to dance as my brand new self
Twirl-twirl, whenever I twirl around and take a jump
The sight of my fluttering skirt makes me so happy
That I just have to twirl around again

I can be true to myself now, so
Twirl-twirl! I'll twirl around and chase after my goal
To all of you, who gave me this bit of courage
I want to say I love you!

There's still a lot more to go
If I run down the path to girlhood from the starting point
It might be there, waiting for me... Love's signal!

It's such a miracle! Twirling around
Yeah, it must be a miracle
If you're getting a sense for the future, twirl around, yay!
It's such a miracle! Twirling around
Yeah, it must be a miracle
"I'm getting a sense for the future," the wind whispers
My chest burns hot with anticipation
I want to become cute -- That's one of my dreams!

It's not bad to want to doll myself up, right?
Sparkle-sparkle! I want to shine brightly
I've fiddled with my hair again and again
Today, I'll definitely make your hearts flutter!

I'm almost there!
The girly tempo of a beginner maiden rises bit by bit
More and more!
I'm running down the path to girlhood from the starting point
That's where it's waiting for me, love's fated signal!

It definitely is a miracle! Sparkling brightly
Every day is a miracle
I wink at the mirror -- Yes, sparkle-sparkle!
It definitely is a miracle! Sparkling brightly
Every day is a miracle
My reflection in the mirror just might be cute
I'm not confident yet, but I'm going to do my best
I want to become lovely! I'll seriously strive for that goal!

It's such a miracle! Twirling around
Yeah, it must be a miracle
If you're getting a sense for the future, twirl around, yay!
It's such a miracle! Twirling around
Yeah, it must be a miracle
I can feel the future! Twirl and twirl

It definitely is a miracle! Sparkling brightly
Every day is a miracle
I wink at the mirror -- Yes, sparkle-sparkle!
It definitely is a miracle! Sparkling brightly
Every day is a miracle
Aiming for cuteness -- That's one of my dreams!/nLanding action
Where should we play today?
Now, let's all Call & Dance!!

No matter where we go, our hearts become one
What we wish for will always be the same, right?
Furthermore, I want to share our strong bond
That’s right, I want to look at you right in front of me

Let’s jump together! And jump a little higher!
When I finally met you
Both our bodies and feelings became a lot lighter because of Yeah!!

From far away, I hear someone tell me to come over here
Even though I don’t know whose voice it is, I hear it loud and clear
There’s still tons of things I want to talk about
If I just wait, it’ll never be conveyed
So that's why I've come!

Our hearts can become one no matter what we do
I want to see your smile, even if your dance is rather sloppy
What's something that will never change?
Maybe it's the light that we secured in our memories just now

Let’s jump together! And jump a little higher!
When I finally met you
Both our bodies and feelings broke out into song because of Yeah!!

It's great when we have fun at a place that's perfect
I want to hear your voice more so I can smile more
It's unbearable how much I want to make sure
That those who experienced a thrill become friends
So that's why I've come!

Landing action
I want someone to call me over
Landing action
I wonder what place will be next?

From far away, I hear someone tell me to come over here

What do you all want to hear? You can rely on us
What do you all want to do? We're taking suggestions!

Let's overwrite those lonely feelings with fun things
We'll make this a place to laugh - idle talk is a form of medicine, you know?

The sky is blue today
We'll talk excitedly, too
Say goodbye to your frowns, and don't stop them on their way out!

If you speak your desires, they'll come true
Let's talk about our dreams, forever
We'll surely achieve them one day

Let's sing! A happy tune that'll make us want to dance
Let's sing! About when we met
It was both a sign and a miracle
It's mysterious, but we're getting along

So, comin' comin' back!
Just staying sulky there doesn't work, you know?
Look over here... Please!

Somehow painful one day, shaking with loneliness one day
Oh yeah, oh yeah! Teach me my boy
Aiming for the waiting night sky
Call me, call me!! The signal you're skipping is "L.O.V.E"

Because I want to hug you with these feelings of love
I'm gazing at only you right here

Always I love you I love you (I want to tell you) I love you I love you
No matter when　Hi!(Hi!) Hi!(Hi!)　Without losing
I'm praying　Ah...!(Let's fight!)
I love you I love you (Love you love you) I love you I love you
Don't forget during the times when you're tired, just a little bit
Recall and think about me　Baby!

The oath your seriousness conceived, don't tell it to anyone
So, goin' goin' now!
If you're too quiet there'll be misunderstandings, you know?
Say something... Please!

Crying in the rain one day, getting drenched and sad one day
Oh yeah, oh yeah! I want to meet you my boy
I've been waiting, my heart is calling out
Call me, call me!! The signal right now is "L.O.V.E"

Once you're in love, everything can be forgiven
Really... Because I am someone that belongs only to you

Always I love you I love you (Unchanging) I love you I love you
Sometimes　Hi!(Hi!) Hi!(Hi!)　Also weak
What's dear to me　Ah...!(I know!)
I love you I love you (Love you love you) I love you I love you
Because you're dear to me, when you want to take a break, I want to protect you gently
I wanna hold you, Baby!

Hi!(Hi!) Hi!(Hi!) Why, I wonder?
Even when you're strong and even when you're weak
Hi!(Hi!) Hi!(Hi!) I love you!
I love all of it, the lonely my boy
Your oath, your heart; you are you are, lonely boy
The passionate you, where is it you're aiming for?

Always I love you I love you (Unchanging) I love you I love you
Sometimes　Hi!(Hi!) Hi!(Hi!)　Also weak
What's dear to me　Ah...!(I know!)

Oh baby I love you!!/n(DJ time, DJ time) Our hearts that want to meet
(Happy time, happy time) I want to connect them
Listen, listen, I’m always
Looking for you

"I’ve given up on everything
I just want to go home for today"
Those sighs have arrived here, arrived at my side

We’ve never stopped trying our best
Our missions are like that sometimes
I want to save you with this song

(DJ night, DJ night) Those songs
(Happy night, happy night)
That you loved
Let’s broadcast them, let them reach you quickly
I want to cheer you up (Reach out, reach out, to you)
Let’s broadcast them (Reach out, reach out, hurry up)

What is it you want to do?
There are times when you lose sight of it
Let's go home already
Today, you should rest a little

I know that we're doing our best
It's alright, and you know it too
Someday, it'll turn out well
So let's rest a little now

Can you hear
My voice?
Let's be in tune together
Tune yourself to me

(Stay tuned)

Let’s broadcast them (Reach out, reach out, hurry up)/nWith a smile, I say "I'll go on ahead" and get on the train
My lips quiver slightly
As painful emotion runs through me

If I could just tell you my feelings
I wouldn’t sigh and do things like write
That single name on the glass with my finger

I wish I could become crystal clear
As I stand in front of you as your friend
This throbbing in my chest that can't be kept hidden--
I don’t want anyone to notice it
Return the person I was, with her heart on her sleeve
Even though we're friends, I'm in love with you
I can’t hide it anymore, I can’t forget about it
With the secret locked within me, I leaned against the window

As the scenery streaming by changes, tears come trickling down
I play it off by pretending to yawn
And look up to gaze outside

Having you near me is painful
You're just too kind
Knowing you've made a habit of talking to that girl
Is breaking my heart

Someday, I want to dream about being tied together
The way lovers are drawn to one another
It's my selfish desire, my painful wish
I don’t want anyone to notice it
I wanted to dream about our hearts being tied together
Obtaining the happiness that lovers have
My selfish desire -- I'm sorry, without a doubt
This secret, marginal love will remain mine alone

The day we first met won’t fade away even now
Why does it continue to sparkle within my memories?

I wish I could become crystal clear
As I stand in front of you as your friend
This throbbing in my chest that can't be kept hidden--
I don’t want anyone to notice it
Return the person I was, with her heart on her sleeve
Even though we're friends, I'm in love with you
I can’t hide it anymore, I can’t forget about it
With the secret locked within me, I leaned against the window/nTry your hardest, never never never give up
Na NaNaNa Na that's what I wanna be
Try your hardest, never never never give up
Na NaNaNa Na that's what I wanna be

It practically takes a genius to be as dense as you
Anyone else would've noticed ages ago

“Huh?”
Pretending it’s a coincidence again today
Should I try ambushing you?
But that’s so lonely
Look over here!

I’m praying, you know
I’m crying, you know (Please)
My love can't, can't bear fruit (can't it?)
Instead of the main plot, it’s a side story (Hey now!)
Fix your habit of going on ahead (I’m over here)
I’m rushing, you know
I’m crying, you know (I've had it with this!)
My love can, can... can, can, can bear fruit?
In short: I like you, so try to like me back (Smooch)

Try your hardest, never never never give up
Na NaNaNa Na that's what I wanna be
Try your hardest, never never never give up
Na NaNaNa Na that's what I wanna be

I'm trying so hard to make you see, yet you don't get it at all
I keep feeling on edge lately, I just can't relax like this

“Roger!”
You’re oblivious to the point of simplicity
My passionate feelings are lightyears away from you
That's why I have to try and do my best
I want to become your girlfriend!

I’m hesitant
I want to feel it (I want to know)
I can, can be caught by love (I was caught)
The whole novel is probably a love story (Lovey-dovey)
I tried writing it for the two of us (It’s a happy end, right?)
I’m troubled
I feel it (Geez, you idiot)
I can, can... can, can, can be caught by love!
In other words... Say 'I love you' aloud (Hug!)

(Dododododo do dodo do) Do your best
Lovey-dovey (ey ey ey)
Lovey-dovey (ey ey ey)
Lovey-dovey (ey ey ey ey)
A happy ending, right?
A happy ending, right?
Come on, come on
I've had it with this
Geez, you idiot

I’m praying, you know
I’m crying, you know (Please)
My love can't, can't bear fruit (can't it?)
Instead of the main plot, it’s a side story (Hey now!)
Fix your habit of going on ahead (I’m over here)

Let’s all become cute! It’s definitely possible.
Just look, even I can… Transform!

My heart is crying out as my memories are torn apart
By a fate that won't let us be together
Look at me...No, don't look...
Both of those options are me
I'll give you a farewell kiss before leaving for a land of sorrow
LOVELESS WORLD

I didn't want to know
About that kindness and warmth
Because I'm returning to a world of eternal darkness

That was the first time I'd been loved by someone
The more I was loved, the more painful it was, and I cried
The forbidden flame of love

Look at me...No, don't look...
My heart is crying out as my memories are torn apart
By a fate that won't let us be together
Look at me...No, don't look...
Both of those options are me
I'll give you a farewell kiss before leaving for a land of sorrow
LOVELESS WORLD

Living the same moments
Sharing the same dreams
So long as my wish won't be granted, I'll have to return to isolation

I smile as I say those cold words
But even if I act distant, it hurts
The flame of love can't be extinguished

Forget...No, don't forget...
I embrace you
I really do want to choose a future of destruction
Forget...No, don't forget... both of those options are me
I head for the darkness as I pray for happiness
LOVELESS WORLD

This flame won't go out
It still burns within me
I want to embrace you here
I want to forget everything

Forget...No, don't forget...
I embrace you
I really do want to choose a future of destruction

Are you staring at me?
I want to avert my gaze but I can't avert it
Oh I want to be burned with passion

Tonight I want to know more than an exciting rhythm
I muttered words bolder than usual
Though they're my own feelings, I don't understand them at all (I don't want to)
These commands (from my heart)
Can't be controlled by reason (such a love)

A voice has arrived that I want to know
I think it's embarrassing
But I want to know more I want to know more
While realizing it's a dream I shouldn't have

Dancing in a red sun dress
Your eyes stare at me
I want to avert my gaze but I can't avert it
To whom does midsummer belong?

I want it to belong to you and me
In this season where our hearts don't stop
It seems like the door to my heart
Will open for the first time
You knock knock my heart

It's impossible that our faltering steps
Always turn feverish
I'm bewildered by these impulses

If I placed
My hand
On top of your hand
Will something begin?

Your profile is illuminated by fireworks
I had a hunch this day would surely come
I can't turn back anymore I don't want to return
I was lured by midsummer

I want to spend summer with you
After all, it's a season where our hearts don't stop
With an oppressively sweet scent
I suddenly felt like crying

Getting closer, separating
My head is getting numb from this dance
Come here, come here
I'm not afraid
Of anything anymore

Dancing in a red sun dress
Your eyes stare at me
I want to avert my gaze, but I can't avert it
To whom does midsummer belong?

I want it to belong to you and me
After all, it's a season where our hearts don't stop
It seems like the door to my heart will open for the first time
You knock knock on my heart!!

Ah, embrace me passionately!/nThere's no one who doesn't worry
In the water, the sunlight wavers
Even if you try to catch it
The light spills out of your hands

The seagulls fly off to the cape, it's a picture perfect, marine colored scene
They quietly melt into the sky, this must be what freedom is

Parasol, the road on the beach will always be the same
But the color of our dreams, we realized it'll change
Parasol, let's play and have fun
Saying see you later, we head towards the next season
Where we'll meet again, the sea breeze knows

Holding our sandals in hand,
When we step onto the cold sand,
The burning hot sun
Felt nostalgic

Even so, we can feel it, this isn't the end
The summer will come again, a different summer

Parallel, I'm glad for who we are now
If we had chosen any differently
We might not be smiling here together
Parallel, the talks of "if's"
Was swept away by the waves
Whether we'll meet again, the sea breeze knows

That horizon line, you want to see it again, don't you?
We ran through the hot summer

Even so, we can feel it, this isn't the end
The summer will come again, a different summer

Parasol, the road on the beach will always be the same
But the color of our dreams, we realized it'll change
Parasol, let's play and have fun
Saying see you later, we head towards the next season
Where we'll meet again, only the sea breeze knows/nI listened with, my eyes closed, to the repeating sound of the waves
Today is quietly flowing by

With no one to pass by, I walked on the street alone
Lalala... Humming the song of love

An emotion as strong as this one 
I don't understand it yet, but someday
I want to try singing with my emotions from the bottom of my heart
(When will that day come?)

Can you wait for me? I want to become a better person
Love is still a distant passion filled with mystery
Can you wait for me? I want to become a better person
That's why I want to know more (There's much more I want to learn)
My aspirations (Watch me) chase after them

"I wonder if I can make an hourglass", that's what I thought as I stood by the sea
Always just rambling on pointlessly

The mood is just a bit sad if I stop and stand here alone
Lalala... The song of love makes me cry

If I try asking someone, will I understand?
It's not something I can comprehend by just asking, is it?
I want to try singing with my emotions─ with the power of love that scorches my heart
(But that's for the future)

Can you believe in me? That I'll surely be able to sing someday
This thing called love, just imagining it, it's my future mission
Can you believe in me? That I'll surely be able to sing someday
That's why without thinking about it, (Can I leave it to its own course?)
In the process (new encounters) might just happen


The sound of the song of love 
Is both kind and sad, isn't it?
Why is it that I've never noticed?
Hey, my chest is starting to hurt
The scent of the song of love 
Is more blue than the breeze of the sea
It's a scent I want to ascertain further
(A scent that is both blue and painful)

Can you wait for me? I want to become a better person
Love is still a distant passion filled with mystery
Can you wait for me? I want to become a better person
That's why I want to know more (There's much more I want to learn)
My aspirations (Watch me chase after them)
Aah, I'm humming the song of love... lalala.../nLet's get along, everyone!
I love you! Because I'm Ai!
Everybody are you ready?

There's seriously no way I can stand every day being boring (No good!)
If you feel bored can't you just do something fun? (That's ok!)
If you're looking down, you can only see the floor (Oh no no)
So let's face forward, and look up at the sky (Yay yay yay)

With our tension high (Hey!) let's be positive (Hey!)
There's no point in worrying
Let's go searching for fun things together!

Go forward! We're going and going and raring to go!
Our hearts are pounding and sounding it out
Here and now in this place, it's ok to leave them be
All your difficult worries
Let's climb over everything with everything we've got
Even though we sometimes get insecure
If you don't challenge yourself, nothing will ever start
When we fall over, it's 'cause we're pitching forward
Heading far ahead, heading far ahead

How much have you cried already? But please, no more
Don't cry!

As long as your sensor for thrilling things is working, you'll be in the right (It's alright!)
It's fine to just walk with your instincts as your guideposts (No doubt about it!)

Sure there'll be days when you're negative
Your mood's down or you're defeated
Things are always easier said than done

But still, keep moving now, moving now, words like "we can't"
Being told that actually gets me more pumped
I'll change the 'impossible' to something that's 'possible'
Even if they laugh at me
After all, beyond the unknown path is a future that's shining with light
If you stretch out your hand, someday you'll grasp hold of it
C'mon, put your hands up, high up in the sky

When you feel lost, try using a loud voice!
everybody say
Going Going
Moving Moving
Going Going
Moving Moving

Go forward! We're going and going and raring to go!
Our hearts are pounding and sounding it out
Here and now in this place, it's ok to leave them be
All your difficult worries
Let's climb over everything with everything we've got
Even though we sometimes get insecure
If you don't challenge yourself, nothing will ever start
Have a never give up spirit!

So let's keep moving now, moving now, words like "we can't"
Being told that actually gets me more pumped
I'll change the 'impossible' to something that's 'possible'
Even if they laugh at me
After all, beyond the unknown path is a future that's shining with light
If you stretch out your hand, someday you'll grasp hold of it
C'mon, put your hands up, high up in the sky
Higher than anyone, high up in the sky/nNo, don’t stop, I’m getting hot from you

“I’m still dreaming an innocent dream”
When I whisper that into your ear
I close my eyes and sigh, It’s your fault
I dissolve into the sea bathing in the moonlight

Before diving into love
I won’t say anything…It’s-A-Se-cret
If I speak I’ll turn into foam, I’m a mermaid

The waves brought me here
Summer love is a painful festa which won’t come twice
I dance with the waves so
Let the magic of sound ring out loudly for this year’s festa

Are you alarmed? Are you nervous?
I kind of know, I’ll know when I turn around
I’m getting hot from you

“Why aren’t you coming here? Are you aware?”
I’ll try teasing you a bit
Those painful excuses are so like you
The tension fills my heart with even more excitement

Symbols are written in the sand with bare feet
If you flip it around it reads I love you
What will you do when you notice? Will you be looking at me?

Next embrace me tightly
I’ll get away nimbly, Because now is the beginning of love
I want to be held tightly after that
You’re so gentle, What I want to know is you acting aggressively

Are you alarmed? Are you nervous?
I’ll pout over and over, I’ll pout even if we cuddle up
Spoil me


The waves brought me here
Summer love is a painful festa which won’t come twice
I dance with the waves so
Let the magic of sound ring out loudly for this year’s festa

Are you alarmed? Are you nervous?
I kind of know, I’ll know when I turn around
Let it ring out, Let the summer love ring out

No, don’t stop, I’m getting hot from you/nThe rhythm gradually changes into a sweet Fruits dance
In a hurry
Looking back at myself
I do not look back at what I have caught
I want to be chased
But I won't say it; But I can't say it 

So, right?
I'll come around, come around, come around
Let's dance and come around, come around


I want fresh experiences no matter what they may be
What we need is probably a feverish love
You don't know? Who is going to come?
Waiting like fruits to be harvested

From a hard, yellow color → it grows pink
I'm trembling shaking
If you reach it now... Yes!

The rhythm gradually changes into a sweet Fruits dance
In a hurry
Looking back at myself
I do not look back at what I have caught
I want to be chased
But I won't say it; But I can't say it 

So, right?
I'll come around, come around, come around
Let's dance and come around, come around

I don't want to forget every new day
I hope if you can keep this secret kiss
Is it too early? Is it good even if only a little?
Fruits are thorny so be careful

Turning blue with a sweet scent → Transformed and ready to be eaten
I try to touch it gently
You... Please do not get lost again!

The passionate, burning hot summer gives out a tingling sensation
It does not stop
Hey, I am about to burst in this season
Surprisingly turning bullish
I want to be hugged
But you know, I will blush; But you know, it is embarrassing.

I, right?
It is intense and come around, come around, come around
I lose and come around, come around


By the time a white ship comes gliding through the beach
So that the distance between us may shrink
A little more... a little more... I try to close my eyelids

The passionate, burning hot summer gives out a tingling sensation
It does not stop
Hey, I am about to burst in this season
Surprisingly turning bullish
I want to be hugged
But you know, I will blush; But you know, it is embarrassing.

I, right?
It is intense and come around, come around, come around
I lose and come around, come around

This passionate, burning heat gives out a tingling sensation
The rhythm gradually changes into a Fruits dance/nμ’sic forever!
Don't forget, our footprints

We made it here with the power we believed in
The future we can see is definitely the same
It's a treasure, all the times we shared
I want to say "Thank you", a friend of my heart!

(μ'sic) From the very start
This meeting was a miracle, I knew that all along
(μ'sic) Everyone's feelings
If we link them all it definitely won't end, Let's do more and more fun things

La-La μ'sical night!
Let's dance on, and convey our joy just like that
We'll become one with our smiles
La-La μ'sical night!
Let's dance on; Time, please let tonight continue on forever
Ah... how about it?

Being surprised at the world unfolding before us
Let's hold hands and continue advancing and running
It's exhilarating, and so will be the coming days
I want to say "Please take care of me" to you.... friend!!

(μ'sic) Gradually growing stronger
This meeting was a miracle, I felt that all along
(μ'sic) Everyone's feelings
If we link them all it definitely won't end, come on let's watch our fun dreams

La-La μ'sical sign!
Let's sing, while bathing in the power of this light
I want to hold these memories close with everyone while smiling
La-La μ'sical sign!
Let's sing, could you please call out loudly? I want to play
Ah... This moment is everything!

μ’sic forever!
Don't forget, our footprints
La-La μ'sical night!
Let's dance on, we're all linked by our joy
I want to say "Thank you"... yeah!
La-La μ'sical night!
Let's dance on, who shall we make our wishes to?
Time please stop (Time please stop) We're all full of happy smiles
La-La μ'sical sign!
Let's sing, while bathing in the power of this light
I want to hold these memories close with everyone while smiling
La-La μ'sical sign!
Let's sing, could you please call out loudly? I want to play
Ah... This moment is everything!

μ’sic forever!
Don't forget, our footprints/nEven if we're always together
Our hearts lose their way when we can't explain our feelings
So let's forget our tears
And sing together

Words are not enough
As there aren't enough words to do it justice - that's why we fail to connect
But I hated the fact
That we drifted apart, it's always been on my mind

I can't stop feeling
That I want you to understand, I'm sure I've hurt you in the process
But I won't bother
Trying to hide this selfishness now as I just can't let go

So let's combine our strength and swim through the sea of dreams
This sea before us today...!

Nobody knows what the future will bring
But I bet it will be fun
If we're all together, I'm sure we can overcome it
As everything starts now, so let's do our best together
Nobody knows what the future will bring
But I really want to make it fun
When we're all together, I start wanting to push myself
As I want to keep growing as I'm a young DREAMER

It seems we'll finally be able to join as one
So let's start by expressing ourselves freely
'Cause I believe there's a new light to be found there


Together just like this, let's swim through the sea of dreams
This sea before us today...!

When the storm comes, let's play until it clears up
I'm sure it'll be fun if we sing
You're not alone so you'll be able to overcome it
Strangely enough, my fear has disappeared
When the storm comes, let's play until it clears up
I really look forward to that too
You're not alone so don't push yourself
It's good to help each other out as we're all excited young DREAMERS

Nobody knows what the future will bring
But I bet it will be fun
If we're all together, I'm sure we can overcome it
As everything starts now, so let's do our best together
Nobody knows what the future will bring
But I really want to make it fun
When we're all together, I start wanting to push myself
As I want to keep growing as I'm a young DREAMER/nWe'll push our limits until the end
(How'll it turn out? Heart-pounding WAVE)
It's time to overcome our impatient selves
(That's right! Go beyond the WAVE!!)
We can't think of anything else
(How'll it turn out? Heart-pounding WAVE)
Our dreams that have become one, run on
(That's right! Can't stop the WAVE!!)

So frustrated, we can't sit still anymore
I'm sure everyone understands that feeling

Can we do it? (HI!) We can! (HI!)
My heart is crying out (the shine it craves)
I'll show you right in front of me
Can we do it? (HI!) We can! (HI!)
That's the only choice (we decided) with super passionate jumps
Can we grab hold of a new light?
Let's believe (YEAH!) 
That a MIRACLE WAVE can bring about miracles

Instead of fretting, just do it, go with a bang!
(It takes guts! An explosive WAVE)
Show me your results, when things change
(That's right! WAVE!! Things have changed)
Were we so naive back then?
(It takes guts! An explosive WAVE)
Our dreams that have become one, run on
(That's right! WAVE!! With lots of power!)

I want to stretch out my hand
With vigor, towards far away
We're all together through thick and thin

Will it come true? (HI!) It will! (HI!)
My wish is the same (My own radiance)
It's not a copy, it's an original HEART WAVE
Will it come true? (HI!) It will! (HI!)
It has to (and so) with super passionate jumps
We'll try to grasp a new light
The biggest (YEAH!) HEART WAVE MIRACLE

A MIRACLE WAVE is calling forth a miracle/nLet's throw our all at each other and grab hold of the future!

The sky and this ocean are both on our side
Shining and saying, "Go do your best!"
To let our voices reach far, far away
Shall we shout our dreams even louder? 

(Full of hope)
Today pulls tomorrow toward itself
It's really fun to grasp the magnet in my heart and run right now
(Let's always go together!)

What shall we do about the future!?
As they look for the shape of their dreams, everyone laughs and cries
Because I'm sure the future us will have the answer
Let's run with everything we have

While singing and getting wet by the rain
I believe the sky will definitely clear
Let's try calling out with a cheerful, cheerful voice
And we'll surely meet our big dreams

I want to grow, and so one by one
I'll overcome my inabilities
In the midst of waves of clouds, a new blue sky is waiting, waiting for us

Let's fly off with high expectations!!
I want to go, With this kind of vigor, whether I cry or laugh
Our expectations are giving us lots of signals
So don't run away, catch hold of this chance!

I live, I live Love Live! days!!
If we throw our all in, won't it come true, this... dream?

What shall we do about the future? The shape of their dreams
Ah Everyone is looking for it, everyone!
Let's fly off with high expectations!!
I want to go, with this kind of vigor, whether I cry or laugh
Because I'm sure the future us will have the answer
Let's run with everything we have, and catch hold of this chance!

Let's become the shining wind 
We got dream!/nLet's become light as I want to shine in the future
This gleam wells up from the bottom of my heart

Even the dreams that had made me cry
Came true because I didn't give up
We all suffered in order to make it here, right?
We're just getting started so I won't falter anymore

Hold your aspirations close for your next task
There'll be a new world just for us (I know it's there)
We say "Aye Aye"

The ship's leaving, so let's sail for the future
The blue sky is smiling (What do you want to do?)
Let's become light as I want to shine in the future
This gleam wells up from the bottom of my heart and I see more of the sights ahead

Let's become light as I want to shine in the future

This gleam wells up from the bottom of my heart and I see more of the sights ahead
Ah! Hold up your tickets to the future we've earned...!/nBut... (Firmly...) Getting closer to "love"! (More!)
More.... (But...) Startled and rushing! (More! Firm!)

But... (Firmly...) A "pure" adventure! (More!)
More... (I knew it...) More of this pure love...! (More! Firm!)


More fidgety than usual, acting cuter than normal
How do we become lovey-dovey?
But... (Today...) Won’t come again

Can’t I believe the magic of love exists somewhere?
The miracle of love
Please... (For today) Awaken

(And so) A pure heart is justice! (It’s pure) You should turn around
(And so) How about gradually letting my sweet (Dreams) into your heart? Treat yourself (To my dreams)

Happy? Dear?
It’s the happiest love in the world
I’ll show you, I’ll show you, Somehow I’ll show you
With a lot of effort, I’ll do my best!
Happy? Dear? Touching?
I love you... (So much...) I love you...
(Catch me) Firmly (More) Look at me
Getting closer to “love”! Because I love you


Something’s different and I'm excited, I want to know who to ask
This is completely pure, pure love
I knew it... (How weird) I’m blushing

Let’s start the magic of love right now, the two of us!
I’m shy but I have courage
Good-bye to it... (How weird) How daring

(Listen) It’s a match through passion! (At length) Shall I talk to you?
(Listen) Let my acutely swelling and warm (Feelings) reach you! Accept (My feelings)

I want to give it! I want to figure it out!
Become the luckiest in the world
I saw it, I saw it, I saw the future
Really, will it turn out this way?
I want to give it! I want to figure it out! I want to be happy!
Stay…(Right here) Stay...
(Being flustered) I’m tired of that (So) Come with me
It’s a "pure" adventure! As I thought, it’s love

How weird... (As I thought) It’s a "pure" adventure! (But!)
How weird... (As I thought) It’s dizzyingly troubling! (Poof! Whoosh!)


I want to give it! I want to figure it out!
For the sake of today
With a "pure love", with "purity", we’re "lovingly" serious
I miss you!!

(Catch me) Firmly (More) Look at me
Getting closer to "love"! Because I love you

More (Firmly...) More firmly (More! Firm!)
Startled and rushing today!/nListen, to this feeling right now
Let me think, let me think, it’s unexplainable
From when we met, to where we are right now
It was short in a long kind of way

The lights we saw together were like a galactic sea (right?)
My heart started beating (Fantastic Moment)
A wish that wishes to be granted [invites] stories, the time to grant it is here
Everyone’s voices gave us wing so… we could fly… we could fly!

It all started from a reckless dream
Everything tied together miraculously
I wonder what will happen
The excitement made every day an adventure every time
From this moment forth I’ll be in your favor even more
Because there is no way we can be separated
It’s not all just memories
We know a new dream will come to life

If we feel like we miss each other
Let’s see, let’s see, let’s sing together!
Even if we’re far apart it doesn’t matter
In the depths of our hearts, we understand each other

No matter how much I say thank you to you, it’s not enough (right?)
It was a wonderful experience (Wonderful moment)
The feelings I want to express (open up) the next doors, where should we go next
With everyone’s voice we can fly forever, with all our energy, with all our energy
We can fly again!

We lock up the moment into this ring
I want to always gaze at it, I wonder which finger is best for this
It’s beautiful, isn’t it…!
Never forget about this sparkling daily life
The map to tomorrow
Shines a bright white and draws the future
It’s not all just memories
We know our endless youth is here 

Because I love your smile (Let’s smile!)
Its fine as just an endless dream right? (Of course!)
You and I are on the way to the same dream, it’s fine, it’s fine, no matter what, it’s our youth!

We lock up the moment into this ring
A flash of light in the finger we want to always gaze at

It all started from a reckless dream
Everything tied together miraculously
I wonder what will happen
The excitement made every day an adventure every time
From this moment forth I’ll be in your favour even more
Because there is no way we can be separated
It’s not all just memories
We know a new dream will come to life/nIf...
We never met, if I had never known you all--
I can't even imagine it now

While fostering the fragments of all your dreams
I found myself, at some point, growing just as passionate
So that everyone's hopes will never dim
I want to protect them, I want to keep on protecting them

I'm sure
We were destined to meet, even if our ways will eventually part
The promise of today's brightness overflowed

And then my dream gave everyone wings
Surrounded by everyone's smiling faces
I never want those precious feelings to fade
I want to embrace them, I want to hold them dear

Even if at times crushing sorrow fills my heart
I'll keep watching over you, always, always

While fostering the fragments of all your dreams
I found myself, at some point, growing just as passionate
My dream gave everyone wings
Surrounded by everyone's smiling faces
I never want those precious feelings to fade
I want to embrace them, I want to hold them dear/nPlease, don't anymore...
Shutting yourself away all alone
Will just make you sad, won't it?
I want you to call out to me

Please, don't anymore, okay?
You pretend you want to be alone
Because you don't want to be hurt, isn't that right?

"Please remember me," I murmured
As the stars shined brightly through the night

There'll be times you want to cry; We can be together then
You may not be able to find any words, but as long as we're together, isn't that fine?

Yes, I know what you mean...
Whenever you bottle up your feelings,
You end up torn up on the inside, don't you?
Why not try talking about how you feel?

Yes, you understand, don't you?
If my heart had wings,
I'd want to send to you an "I love you"

So remember me, okay?
With a sigh, the stars fell throughout the night

There'll be times you want to cry; We can be together then
You may not be able to find any words, but as long as we're together, isn't that fine?
Whenever you want to see me, we can be together
You may not be able to find the right words, but as long as we're together, isn't that fine?

You don't have to be alone anymore/n"Is there something you want to forget?"
The message I sent to your heart, do receive it

Dance, dance, to find a passion - were we born for this very purpose?
Dance, dance, surely it is so
So let's dream and let's dance

MY dance☆TONIGHT (DANCING TONIGHT) is the very best
MY dance☆TONIGHT (DANCING TONIGHT) let's make that today

Someday we'll spread out... there! Spread wide!
With the strength of our hard work we call forth a miracle
In this world, hearts that want to shine
When gathered together, will think of something new and run
We can't see beneath our feet, but we stretch out our arms like wings

Dance, dance,　we yearn to be a light that shines forever
Dance, dance, "Surely some day,
It will come true," is our dance

My dance☆TONIGHT (DANCING TONIGHT) to the future
MY dance☆TONIGHT (DANCING TONIGHT) connect me!

Guided by a voice inside, the road is open once again
So let's go strongly until the end

Dance, dance, to find a passion - were we born for this very purpose?
Dance, dance, surely it is so
So let's dream and let's dance

MY dance☆TONIGHT (DANCING TONIGHT) is the very best
MY dance☆TONIGHT (DANCING TONIGHT) let's make that today/nSplash! Spark! and Shining the Summer!
1 2 3 yeah!

Don't just wait here, we have to come together in the summer time!
(Oh yeah, summer time!!) 
It looks like we'll have an unbelievable summer, I wonder if you're ready for it like me?
If you wait all alone, it'll be bye-bye to summer time in the blink of an eye
(Oh yeah, summer time!!)
So if you don't want to be left behind, you better come soon

My heart is singing in this fleeting dream
Let's have an adventure in the beach sky

It's no good to space out the whole time
I want to have so much fun I can feel my heart pound
So (let's go!) so (let's go!)
This year we only have one chance

Let's play and splash! (splash!!) 
The blueness of the sea we've jumped into (good feeling)
Is dreaming of the door to an unending summer, don't you know?
Let's play and splash! (splash!!) 
If you're still hesitating after we were shown that after jumping in
I'll have to give you the worst summer summer summer you've ever had

This hot summer season has got to be awesome
(Oh yeah, summer time!!)
I'm sure we'll find something more exciting than ever before

Once you hear the beat track, call me, call you!
Turn your towel around with a "boon boon", and stand up!!

Throw your worries away
Isn't summer for having fun?

If you feel like pouting, let's go and fly
Show me that smiling face of yours!

After all (let's go!) after all (let's go!)
This year we only have one chance

Altogether, spark! (spark!!)
I just realised that one day these will become treasured memories (good smiling!)
I just know that even that is so like summer!
Altogether, spark! (spark!!)
Let's dance until we sweat to the taiko (and then) eat some ice cream

One day, will I think back on this season?
Oh summer...
I'm dreaming of a door to an endless summer, don't you know?
Altogether, spark! (spark!!)
Let's dance until we sweat to the taiko drums, (and then) ice cream will be (heaven)
The best summer summer time
Let's play and splash! (splash!!)
Just where is the door to an endless summer?
Let's jump into the blue ocean and dive down to find it
Summer summer summer is for everyone!/nThe sound of rain beats against my window
And from the sky sadness like my own pours down, endlessly drenching the present
I don't need things like memories
They only make my heart hurt
no more September rain no more September rain

You were always by my side
And it was never necessary
To go out of the way to make sure of your feelings

I wonder if, because we naturally got along,
I hadn't been worried at all
Why? I ask the waves, but

I didn't know the thoughts that the beginning of summer brought me
Would disappear by the time 
This exciting, passionate season ended

The sky above the coast lights up, but suddenly clouds have drifted in
The rain falls heavily, just like the tears inside me
I really believed a summer this fun
Would continue on forever
but now... September rain but now... September rain

Sooner or later these memories will fade away
They'll be buried with the countless changing of seasons
And then will I be able to smile?

The beginning of summer (with its scorching rays)
Is full of sweet expectations (premonitions of meetings)
When summer ends, they'll disappear. Isn't it painful?
No one is around, I'm all alone

The sound of rain beats against my window
And from the sky sadness like my own pours down, endlessly drenching the present
I don't need things like memories
They only make my heart hurt
no more September rain no more September rain

The sky above the coast lights up, but suddenly clouds have drifted in
The rain falls heavily, just like the tears inside me
I really believed a summer this fun
Would continue on forever
but now... September rain but now... September rain/nI sigh, alone on the beach
As I continue to recall your smile
My sighs linger in the air
Even after all this time, my heart still hurts
When summer ended, my love ended as well (Farewell)

Every day with you was so miraculously fun
When did the autumn breeze begin to blow?

If only I could see you one more time (I know I can't)
I wish my love could reach you
If only I could see you one more time...
I don't want to forget that blue coral reef

I can't return to those exciting days
During that season, all of the time spent awake was precious
We embraced that excitement
As we walked together, on and on
When summer ended, our love disappeared as well (Farewell)

I believed that our happiness would continue on forever
So why did you leave me behind?

Those memories are already far, far away (A beautiful dream)
Even though my love hasn't changed
Those memories are already far, far away...
Love is a mirage that will disappear eventually

I won't forget the heat from the white sand, or the color of your tanned skin
They'll become precious memories (They will, they will)
But even so, these tears will never dry up

If only I could see you one more time (I know I can't)
I wish my love could reach you
If only I could see you one more time...
I don't want to forget that blue coral reef
(Alone on the beach... sighing to myself...)
(Alone on the beach... sighing to myself...)/nSummer wing
Fly high, Summer wing

Why did tomorrow's heart-pounding excitement appear to me… What should I do?
Catch it, Shinin' more, Dreamin' more
We'll have so much fun!

Wings sprout out, taking my heart above the clouds
Lured to a distant sky, a distant beach
Speed up and F.L.Y!!

While basking tons and tons in the sunlight
(Sparkle, sparkle, sparkling, a dazzling feeling)
(Sparkle, sparkle, shimmering, sweat drips)
Let's pile up the shining memories (Sparkle, sparkle, sparkling, shining dreams)
I had searched for this one-time season

It's midsummer's fault, 1,2,Jump!
A shower of light bursts out
This feeling is great, isn't it great?
Nod in agreement, it’s Vacation (Summer wing)
With a summer-colored smile, 1,2,Jump!
I want to show you a twinkling face
Being together is great, isn't it great?
Nod in agreement! (Summer wing)

The weather's hot but (Because things are hot) Because things are hot (It's nice)
It's nice (And fun) And fun
Summer day

Our hearts pound as we pass by each other… What could be the matter?
I'll chase it, that's right, Shinin', that's right, Dreamin'
What a mysterious premonition

I feel nostalgia from the passing breeze
If I look up, I'll see a distant sky, a distant beach
Enthusiastically T.R.Y!!

Because we were able to meet here at long, long last
(Sparkle, sparkle, sparkling, a happy feeling)
(Sparkle, sparkle, shimmering, we were able to meet here)
Create fantastic memories with me! (Sparkle, sparkle, sparkling, my dreams)
I had searched for a miracle within your warm heart

A light more definite than the stars, 1,2,Love!
If such a light illuminates the night
The future will exist, it exists, right?
This is the best Location (Summer time)
Launching someone's throbbing heart, 1,2,Love!
All the way to the stars
Hope exists, it exists, right?
State your desires

A light more definite than the stars, 1,2,Love!
If such a light illuminates the night
The future will exist, it exists, right?
Nod in agreement, it's Vacation

It’s midsummer's fault, 1,2,Jump!
A shower of light bursts out
This feeling is great, isn't it great?
Nod in agreement, it's Vacation (Summer wing)
With a summer-colored smile, 1,2,Jump!
I want to show you a twinkling face
Being together is great, isn't it great?
Nod in agreement! (Summer wing)
The weather's hot but (Because things are hot) Because things are hot (It's nice)

It's nice (And fun) And fun
Summer day/nI feel as though our encounter has changed me
I found the person I want to become
I've been always, always raising up
This longing, only in my heart

Along the great big rope, everybody jumped, playing together
But I alone was too scared to join
Hesitating like a child
I was always waiting for you

When I was about to give up, your hand reached out to support me
The warmth of your gentle hand-- I love it

My gratitude is about to overflow
Little by little, my dream draws closer
My gratitude is about to overflow...
Thank you
I'm happy, so happy that I don't know what to do
So happy that my tears come spilling out
I'm sorry

Rather than hanging my head, unable to form words
I'll say goodbye to these feelings of hesitation
I've always, always longed to see you
I can't let it end only in my heart

Over and over, everyone jumped along the jump rope
And I smiled and laughed, too
Let's always be together and play
That feeling is precious to me

When I lost my way, your eyes led me
Those gentle eyes made my wish come true

This throbbing in my heart won't disappear with a 'thank you'
Little by little, I'm grabbing hold of my dream
This throbbing in my heart won't disappear with a 'thank you'
Thank you
Isn't it fun? Isn't it fun? When I try to embrace you
My tears come spilling out
I'm sorry

My gratitude is about to overflow
Little by little, my dream draws closer
My gratitude is about to overflow...
Thank you
I'm happy, so happy that I don't know what to do
So happy that my tears come spilling out
I'm sorry/nAfter finishing my homework
I just want to jump in
On my fluffy bed
I just want to cuddle.

Sleeping Beauty in the forest
Ah, how I long to be you.
Because you can sleep all the time
And it's such a happiness.

Good morning, everyone
Perhaps this is inside of a dream
But I'm always doing my best.
Of course I'm sleeping my best too.
All the time

Is it this time again?
Let me sleep just a little bit more...
Goodnight/nRather than knowing nothing and growing timid

There'll be a song that will suddenly cross your mind
My heart continually whispers that we can return to that time

The sun is different yet the same
I realized, once I was carried far away
It might be too late but I'll try to tell you
It won't be now; it'll be further in the future

Stay cheerful, everyone, in hopes that we can meet again
Our feelings of wanting to meet is what connects us
Oh until then, let's try to do our best
By ourselves, until the day we can talk together again
Vividly, I see our dream once again
To seek a radiant light
We face ahead towards someplace new
Where will this path we set out on lead to?

I recall
The wind by the seashore
My heart will never forget the color of the sky back then

The cityscape, so gentle,
Becomes so vibrant at a distance
I loved it, but I couldn't stay still
We each must search for our own place

We face ahead, walk towards someplace new
Will the path always be straight? Probably not

So stay cheerful, everyone, in hopes that we can meet again
Our feelings of wanting to meet is what connects us
Oh until then, let's try to do our best
By ourselves, until the day we can talk together again
Once you've set out, let's try to dream again
Let's go search for that radiant light/nAll of these memories are important and always will be
This wonderful thing is our one and only precious gift
No matter how far it is
I'm sure you can see this beautiful scenery
Inside your heart, because deep down are your feelings

I want to see even if it's this once
Closing your eyes and together
We can all hear that song
Where should we be heading to? Let's go together!

We will not forget, we're sure we won't as long as we have dreams
There's someone we all want to become someday
We will not forget, never forget what it means to believe
Surely after tomorrow, I will be closer to my dreams

Even if I was alone, I always felt the same way and that made me think
That this feeling was a cherishble and made me not let it go
This bond, this wonderful story that will never disappear
All the things I've been able to achieve
Are amazing! Thank you my friends

I want to finally see it
Do you get it? I want to call everyone here
With this song that we always hear
There's a long way to go, let's go together!

It will never stop, I'm sure it won't this warm throb
You and I will always be connected from this point onwards
It will never stop, I'm sure it won't get even more warm
Let's go on as our hands will reach for that new glow

Even though I'm still a novice at the moment
We will have to keep going, that's the thing we're going to do in the future!!

We will not forget, we're sure we won't as long as we have dreams
There's someone we all want to become someday
We will not forget, never forget what it means to believe
Surely after tomorrow, I will be closer to my dreams

It will never stop, I'm sure it won't this warm throb
You and I will always be connected from this point onwards
It will never stop, I'm sure it won't get even more warm
Let's go on as our hands will reach for that new glow/nCan you cage me?
Only just for you
The melody I want to sing right now, is a poem of love

'cause I'm in love I'm singin' love

Just for a while in this windswept night, I want to know your heart
"I should give up", I thought
But that's impossible, and when I finally realised that
I decided to live true to my heart

Always
Pursuing it,
Holding it close,
In the excitement... The feeling of love I want to give you
Always!

Don't erase this melody
For our story, the day when we can become happy has come
Within my wishing, hurting heart
Can you cage me?
Only just for you
The melody I want to sing right now, is a poem of love

'cause I'm in love I'm singin' love
That which I love, is right in front of me

Voices also contain warmth, a way to convey my feelings to you
It may be a frail sound but that doesn't matter
When I put my feelings into them, these words become passionate

That's why
Even while hesitating
Even in the midst of tears
While receiving... The feeling of love I want to give you
That's why!

While embracing this love song
Our encounter was for us to be entwined like a fairy-tale, right?
The dream I want to try believing in
Will be held close to my heart till dawn
The Nightingale that wants to play this tune
When did you also enter this cage without me noticing

Always
Pursuing it,
Holding it close,
In the excitement... The feeling of love I want to give you
Always!

Don't erase this melody
For our story, the day when we can become happy has come
Within my wishing, hurting heart
Can you cage me?
Only just for you
The melody I want to sing right now, is a poem of love
Within this cage with only the two of us, I'll sing a poem of love

'cause I'm in love I'm singin' love
That which I love, is right in front of me/nNico pretty! Smile, smile!  Nico pretty! Yeah! Smile!

So (Come on) In order to meet here (Yes, I know!)

The place we aim for is (High)

You forget and mistake our promises
I want to know but I’m scared
The me that’s smiling like always is quite cruel

Please don’t give me a ranking
I want you to tell me that I’m the only one

Constellation of winter please give me strength
and invite you to the Orion with no exit
I want to confirm this love under this night sky with just the two of us
Who else do you need? You can’t decide that you don’t need me
I won’t let you exit
From the darkness
You can’t escape you can’t escape please…

My passion can’t be stopped
It’s bigger and stronger than yours
From the start, I felt that it would be a painful dream
But the brakes were already broken

Throw away everything except me
I want you to tell me that's your only wish

Even though the frozen sighs were calling your name
They closely missed the lights of Sirius in the frozen sky
After the sun rises will this love disappear?
Please don't let me think that this is nothing but an illusion
I love you I love you please tell me the painful truth 
I won't run away I won’t run away please…

After the sun rises will this love disappear?
Please don't let me think that this is nothing but an illusion

Constellation of winter please give me strength

Who else do you need? You can’t decide that you don’t need me
I won’t let you exit
From the darkness
You can’t escape you can’t escape please…/nThe road we're on always seems long
But is actually short. It's because we met,
That we have what we have now

The 9 of us stand on stage, 
But everyone here feels like the 10th member
That's what we have now

I learned the joy of having our hearts connected
You've supported me so much
I'm really going to cry

I can't say enough how thankful I am
I'll throw my whole body into it, you're our friend too!

Nothing stays the same
Somehow I get that
But surely, this passion won't ever change

Can we keep chasing our dreams forever?
Because you gave me a nod
I really love you

Ah, please don't ever forget, that we were all here
Let's make countless memories
And once again, reach our hands out to the light

I can't say enough how thankful I am
I'll throw my whole body into it, you're our friend too!
The 10th member is you, you're our friend too!

The 10th member is you, you're our friend too!

It's not logic but an earnest feeling
Do you possess rules of freedom and courage?

・Don't fear progress
・Share the joy
Even if it's only those two, I want to uphold them without fail

Oh, Love & Peace
Let my heart become a gentle breeze
Yes, I want to give you energy so you'll do your best
Oh, Love & Peace
When you're sad, I vow
To always hold you tight, don't forget that

Even if it's painful, cry no more
Let's graduate from the solitude, Love & Peace


Becoming too reckless is agonizing
Let's look back and take a deep breath
Everyone loves freedom and courage

・Don't hate yourself
・Don't ridicule purity
Even if it’s embarrassing, I have something I want to say

Oh, You may dream
Let's create a fun story
Because I always want to go with you
Oh, You may dream
You probably won't give up? I'm sure!
Let's smile even when we're in a pinch, we'll make it somehow

Come, the dark night is vexing and restless but
The dawn is near, You may dream


Even if it's just a bit of courage
If you have that, then someday, things will certainly change
For everyone, things start from a little freedom
Aim for the skies, and soon you'll be free

Oh, Love & Peace
Let my heart become a gentle breeze
Yes, I want to give you energy so you'll do your best
Oh, Love & Peace

To always hold you tight, don't forget that

Even if it's painful, cry no more

This is the moment we’ve been waiting for

Once we realize it, everything will fall into place
Our hearts calling to the future with all their might
We'll move forward, holding each other's shaking hands

After missing each other along the way, we turn back at the same time.
See? That feeling in our hearts really was the same all along

In order to take hold of something, (Dreams are so complicated...)
It takes to never give up! (Right?)
Let our feelings become one
No matter where we may be, we believe in the same tomorrow

Wow wow, always following our hearts!
Wow wow, always joining as one!

Sometimes growing further apart, sometimes growing closer,
Things haven't gone too smoothly;
There was something I was never able to tell you

Putting on serious faces, we burst into laughter at the same time
We really are connected after all.. I'm so happy!

When chasing a dream that's precious to you, you realize who means the most to you
If your feelings always remain the same,
Then even if you're heading for different places, you can still believe

I was amid days that could never be replaced
I finally realized I'm not alone
Those irreplaceable days (in this place) continued on (one after another)
I finally realized I'm not alone ('Cause we're together)

In order to take hold of something, (Dreams are so complicated...)
It takes to never give up! (Right?)
Let our feelings become one
No matter where we may be, we believe in the same tomorrow
When chasing a dream that's precious to you, you realize who means the most to you
If your feelings always remain the same, (I can tell, our feelings are the same)
Then even if you're heading for different places, you can still believe (I believe)/nThe morning sun is dazzling, if you climb up this hill
The leaves of the gingko tree waver on the way to school

Your back (If I find it)
Overtake you and use the chance (I'll)
To always say good morning

Even though I couldn't confess, I loved you
Even though we were on the same street as back then

Walking by myself, searching for someone who isn't there
Embarrassed of my own feelings
I want to meet you, so my heart is calling out
Because if you were to be just a memory, I can't stand that

Somehow everyday, even if it was just a single word
Our conversations were so nostalgic

Recently (I'd like to know)
How are you spending your days? (After all)
I heard you have a lover... It's a lie, right?

I can't give up, not with those kind eyes
I dream of those times and cry as I wake

That's why my feelings now, I have no choice but to convey them
For the sake of this love which will change the future
I want to meet you, so my heart is calling out
I want to try making more memories with the two of us

Walking by myself, searching for someone who isn't there
Embarrassed of my own feelings
I want to meet you, so my heart is calling out
I've decided to muster my courage
Aa, letting it be only a memory
Is something I can't stand/nDon't leave...
With my fingertips, I want to convey that to you

Talking within dreams, deep within your mind,
While feeling a passion that cannot be extinguished
This me that's following you,
Just a little bit, I want you to notice me

I want to run through time together with you
Even if drenched with tears, I won't regret it

Don't leave...
With my fingertips, I want to convey that to you
For the sake of love, I'll flicker but burn on
I want to see the same stars


We're loved, but it's still lonely
Seeking each other's tenderness
There's a future waiting to be born for us
I believe in it, that's why I won't hesitate anymore

No matter what kind of tomorrow you're searching for
Your wounded heart, I want to embrace it

If we hug, it'll become warm
I love you... and our hearts will race
The two of us that falls into silence
Within us is the light of the crescent moon


Even if drenched with tears, I won't regret it

Don't leave...
With my fingertips, I want to convey that to you

If we hug, it'll become warm
I love you... and our hearts will race
For the sake of love, I'll flicker but burn on
I want to see the same stars; The two of us, in the same place

No matter when, these same stars are; No matter when, the stars of us two/nWhat's going to happen from now on?
A dream is knocking against my chest
If I dash off towards it, I feel like it'll come true

In the next world
My dance with you will begin
A passionate harmony of premonitions and expectations

My wish to shine, has one day
Grown even bigger
"I want a special radiance!"

One More Story, a brand new story
When I'm chasing it,
Aah, I can't stop smiling
One More Story, a fresh new story
Who is waiting for me?
Aah, I want to feel my heart race
So c'mon, let's go!

Heading towards an unfamiliar road
My next steps are calling
Let's be more greedy
And dream, shall we?

Because I was shone on, I want to try shining
Even it's still a small light
It should still reach someone!

Sunshine Story, a story in our hearts
If we gather up all these encounters
Ah, our hopes will widen as well
Sunshine Story, a story in your heart
No two stories are the same!
Ah, if you want to sparkle
Then, let's go!

It's surely, surely something greater than you can imagine
(Something's going to happen from here on out)
And so, and so, have you resolved yourself?
(Believe in your own power)
The future I want to make certain of
Because I can't see it, my heart is throbbing　Yes!!

One More Story, a brand new story
When I'm chasing it,
Aah, I can't stop smiling
One More Story, a fresh new story
Who is waiting for me?
Aah, I want to feel my heart race
So c'mon, let's go!/nHolding you tight, I'll never let go again
You're caught in the youngest princess' heart!

The blue sea hides a door waiting for love,
You know of such a rumor, right?
An eternal paradise

You've made your choice now
Don't run away
Let us both watch this sweet-sour dream together

This world of people will (soon, soon) change but
My wish will (never change)
I want to shake you more violently than the whirling tides

It's an ancient fairy tale, that within a legendary palace
A gentleman who fell in love
Could never return (it was told)
Tonight's story, will revive that legend
I'm certain you've fallen in love
That's right, you've come just for me
Forget everything else, let us sway and dance

Let's decorate using this red coral, like the flame of love
Maybe it's the color of jealousy
An eternal prison


You've made your choice now
Don't run away
Let us both watch this unending dream together

It's love, right? It's love! Dreaming and burning in the waves



This world of people will (soon, soon) change but
My wish will (never change)
I want to shake you and tie you down more violently than the whirling tides

It's an ancient fairy tale, that within a legendary palace
A gentleman who fell in love
Could never return (it was told)
Tonight's story, will revive that legend
I'm certain you've fallen in love
That's right, you've come just for me
Forget everything else, let us sway and dance
Forget everything else...!

Holding you tight, I'll never let go again
You're caught in the youngest princess' heart!
Holding you tight, I'll never, never let you go again
You're caught in the youngest princess' heart!/nYou can't be playing such mean pranks
Come on, stop that! (Straighten up!)
Shove those jokes into your pocket! (Think about it seriously)
I'll teasingly scold you with a super scary face
Come on already! (Straighten up!)
You're best when you're serious, after all
So let's kiss! (Was that too mean?) Just kidding!

(Hey hey!)

Don't turn away (I want you to keep looking at me)
Hold me tight; I want to live out my youth...

I won't know that you think I'm cute unless you say so!
This love is too lonely
I'll dote on you more, okay? (Okay? Okay? Okay?)
That's just what girls do!

You can't be playing such mean pranks
Come on, stop that! (Straighten up!)
Shove those jokes into your pocket! (Think about it seriously)
I'll teasingly scold you with a super scary face
Come on already! (Straighten up!)
You're best when you're serious, after all
So let's kiss! (Was that too mean?) Just kidding!

(Hey hey!)

We're getting closer and closer (My ears feel hot)
I don't want you to go anywhere, but the words just won't come out...

I'm waiting for your confession of love, but aah, you're so slow!
Painful love is prohibited
Today's your chance (Yes, yes, yes)
Tomorrow I'll be a true maiden!

I'm indecisive about the things I really hate
I don't know what to do! (Straighten up!)
I have to pay attention to what truly matters (Impatiently)
My words are becoming meaner than they should
I don't know what to do! (Straighten up!)
I want you to stay serious
So why are you doing this? (I'm disappointed!) It's too bad...!

Learn the way of a maiden!

You can't be playing such mean pranks
Come on, stop that! (Straighten up!)
Shove those jokes into your pocket! (Think about it seriously)
I'll teasingly scold you with a super scary face
Come on already! (Straighten up!)
You're best when you're serious, after all
So let's kiss! (Was that too mean?) Just kidding!

(Hey hey!)/nWe met, so I’m sure no matter how far apart we are,
Someday we will meet again

Since we all had different dreams, they all came true in different ways
Ah, I understand now
But, I’m sure that when we realized that,
Beautiful bonds between us were born, irreplaceable bonds

We chase after each other and miss each other (Always)
Miss each other and chase after each other (Always)
I’ll treasure the joy we felt when our paths finally crossed
This won’t be the last time, okay? (I want to talk with you more, and more!)

Over the rainbow 
Let’s sing while basking in the light and our hearts will be connected
Let’s make a promise on the vanishing rainbow
I won’t ever forget you
So don’t ever forget me

(Oh! So we go!)
Nothing will start just by dreaming, we haven’t put in enough effort yet
Look up at the sky, your future self is at the end of the rainbow, doing their best
I’ve made my decision, and my decision is to prove I can stick through it to the end
I have to keep trying until you accept it, since you can’t forgive yourself

We’ll get closer after we grow apart (And then)
Grow apart as we get closer (And then)
I think about how we can open up to each other, how I want to be your strength
I’ve been waiting for this moment (I’m so glad, so glad we met)

Fly to the rainbow 
Let’s dance so that we can fly on our wishes, and our hearts will be connected
We met, so I’m sure no matter how far apart we are,
We can meet again, someday
I’m sure someday we can meet again

How is it that they go by in the blink of an eye like that?
The seasons aren’t able to come to a halt
Today too (goes by), today (goes by) can only look forward
And it won’t ever come again…

(Go next!)
Over the rainbow
Let’s sing while basking in the light and our hearts will be connected
Let’s make a promise on the vanishing rainbow
I won’t ever forget you
Fly to the rainbow
Let’s dance so that we can fly on our wishes, and our hearts will be connected
We met, so I’m sure no matter how far apart we are,
We can meet again, someday
I’m sure someday we can meet again/nAs if it's nothing special, 
We laugh next to each other everyday
But lately I think I understand a little
That it's something pretty difficult

When I came to know sadness
That I can't put into words
Frustrated at my powerlessness
My tears plip-plopped down

But, when I think with a smile
About the things to look forward to tomorrow
The sky in my heart clears
Ah, I'm always wishing for happiness
Let's go to sleep, with a literary air
Goodnight, everyone!

You'll understand my feelings somehow
We're always together, so have they reached you yet?
Maybe I can use telepathy
If our bond is so happy

With words or not, I want to make sure they do
Though I still can't think of how
But it seems like courage is welling up
Little by little I can grow stronger

So tomorrow, with a smile
I'll do my best again, because good fortune starts with a smile
I feel like it's starting
Ah, I tried raising my cheeks in front of a mirror
I was able to smile so beautifully with my strange expression
Goodnight, everyone!

With a smile I think by myself
About the things to look forward to tomorrow
The sky in my heart clears
Ah, I'm always wishing for happiness
Let's go to sleep, with a literary air
Goodnight, everyone!
Smile, we'll see each other again
Goodnight, everyone!/nAt a table in an empty cafe
I rest my chin in my hand and think
What are you doing now?
Who are you spending your time with?

I take out
The postcard I bought earlier
I try writing "How are you?"
But I can't find the right words to follow

We talk (oh yeah)
Everyday, but it's just not enough!

You're so far from me now, and with these lonely feelings
I'm drinking my black tea that's already gotten cold
But one day, yes, one day
I feel as though we'll meet again, so
I won't let myself feel down!

My handwriting feels so awkward
As I looked over the little letters
It just gets worse and worse
Then my ballpoint pen spun

And flew out of my hand (oh no!)
"How could that have happened?"
I said, laughing

I'll put down a few final words
Like an extra, (a P.S.)
Thank you very much
Because one day, yes, one day
I know we'll meet again
I'm waiting for that day

I don't need a reply
But what a fun a season that was (I need you)
Thinking back on it
My chest tightens
And hurts a little

You're so far from me now, and with these lonely feelings
I'm drinking my black tea that's already gotten cold
But one day, yes, one day
I feel as though we'll meet again
It's all because of you, isn't it?
I'll put down a few final words
Like an extra, (a P.S.)
Thank you very much
Because one day, yes, one day
I know we'll meet again
I'm waiting for that day
But it's okay to write you a postcard, right?

Thank you!/nThree, two, one, live!

Dance party, dance party
It's almost time for the farewell parade
Jump into the air with a shout, "Let's go!" (Jumpin' jumpin' high!)

Dance party, dance party
We'll meet again, though
Don't forget about my melody (Don't forget me!)

Together, say yeah yeah yeah! You too, say yeah yeah yeah!
We'll happily shout out
Together, say yeah yeah yeah! You too, say yeah yeah yeah!
We'll have a Paradise Live (Three, two, three, two, one, live!)

Farewell, farewell, but we'll surely meet again soon
Promise me that you'll wait for me until then (Yes!)
Farewell, farewell, but we'll surely meet again
Until then, I'll do my very best to show you an even brighter smile
Oh baby, I'm goin' now! Goin' now! Yeah! Yeah!
Oh baby, I love you! I love you! Yeah! Yeah!
Oh baby, I'm goin' now! Goin' now! Yeah! Yeah!
I'll shout even louder, "I love you!"

Don't worry, don't worry
I want to experience excitement
I hope tomorrow will make my heart race (Searchin' searchin' heart!)

Don't worry, don't worry
There's still room for our strength to grow
No one can stop our melody (All together!)

My heart is on fire, yeah yeah yeah!
We're shining as we burn bright
My heart is on fire, yeah yeah yeah!
It'll be an amazing Paradise Live (Three, two, three, two, one, live!)

Let's go to make our next dream come true
Hurry, don't look back, I want to move forward (Yes!)
We're on a journey to make our next dream come true
I'll work hard to leap towards that world
Oh baby, I'm goin' now! Goin' now! Yeah! Yeah!
Oh baby, I need you! I need you! Yeah! Yeah!
Oh baby, I'm goin' now! Goin' now! Yeah! Yeah!
In this vast world, "I need you!"

Let's go to make our next dream come true
Hurry, don't look back, I want to move forward (Yes!)
We're on a journey to make our next dream come true

Farewell, farewell, but we'll surely meet again soon
Promise me that you'll wait for me until then (Yes!)

Oh baby, I'm goin' now! Goin' now! Yeah! Yeah!
Oh baby, I love you! I love you! Yeah! Yeah!
Oh baby, I'm goin' now! Goin' now! Yeah! Yeah!
I'll shout even louder, "I love you!"/nMany different sounds flow out from within me,
They’re not all beautiful, but a kind melody from somewhere
Blends in with my new dreams and tears in a concerto

Has it been slumbering all this time?
The passion within my heart
"Please wake up" I've realised that's what you called out to me that day

Although I face the keyboard alone, but,
It can feel it… I’m not alone
Our feelings are always connected, aren’t they?
I can put my faith in that,
That's why I can try anything I wish without fear
And become stronger


Although my body trembles with nervousness, I head towards the promised place that awaits me
I inhale deeply and take a large step forward

If I calmly and slowly
Move my fingertips
With a smile, I’ll play an arpeggio and become free

I want to envelop you in a world of music
Please accept these feelings of mine
I want the sound of my ‘thank you’s to reach you
That’s why I’m playing this melody
It might sound a little too grandiose, but it’s true
So please don’t forget it


Maybe I’ll be able to convey it through the piano, my appreciation for everyone
That’s why, that’s why I’ll play it again and again, this joyous melody

I want to envelop you in a world of music
Please accept these feelings of mine
I want the sound of my ‘thank you’s to reach you
That’s why I’m playing this melody
It might sound a little too grandiose, but it’s true
So please don’t forget it
I’m really glad to have met you, so please, don’t ever forget it/nPo-Po-Pop! I've been waiting I've been waiting for you

Can I do? I take it, baby! Can I do? I make it, baby!

Yeah, are you leaving?
I’m not gonna chase after you
Basically, I hate creating crowds

I’m someone who understands the pain of loneliness
Sometimes we trade words
and think of each other at our own places
Boosting up each other’s day

What’cha do what’cha do? I do “Private Wars”
Hey, get a hold of justice and be sly
What’cha do what’cha do? I do “Private Wars”
Hey, life’s got a bit of courage and passion, doesn't it?

Can I do? I take it, baby! Can I do? I make it, baby!
Can I do? I take it, baby! Can I do? I make it, baby!

Oh, are you quitting already?
You've got no patience at all
Ah… So you don’t really want it

Getting serious is tough, but rather than complaining about it
I want to run without breaking a sweat
I won’t ask for favors, nor will I give up
So beautifully, super action please

What’cha do what’cha do? I know “Dangerous Wars”
Just being some saintly girl isn’t my thing
What’cha do what’cha do? I know “Dangerous Wars”
Just throwing in the towel on life counts as retreating, doesn't it?

Let me rush through this boring and Bad world
I don’t want to act according to plans

What’cha do what’cha do? I do “Private Wars”

Can I do? I take it, baby! Can I do? I make it, baby!/nCorrect your prejudices!
I won't say things like that 
I wandered around searching for the things I like, just the things I like, and then
Where am I? Where is this again? 
An unrecognizable street corner
Nationality unknown (Huh?) Age untold (No!) The gamblers gathered here (Nico too!)

The blue building's lights take the night to the future 
Changing completely, a suspicious illusion (I don't get what you mean~)

PSYCHIC FIRE everybody everybody GO! (fu! fu!)
Inside my head it's PICA PICARESQUE (wu~ wu~ wu~ wu)
I wanna have a dangerous love (fu! fu!) My heart's flame is burning (Ah~ hi! hi! hi! hi)
I'm calling to you, I want to connect with you...notice me! 



Try acting on your whims!
And then I run away
The system that makes things you want to do come true just by wanting to do them
Is it a phantom? A delusion?
An unnatural townscape 
Existence unknown (Nico!) Analysis impossible (Maki!) A juggler that sells dreams (Elichika!)

I drilled into these thick walls, please open the door 
Don't agree with this deceptive solution (Harasho!)

PSYCHIC DARLING what kind of what kind of LOVE! (fu! fu!)
Being forgetful is ROMA ROMANESQUE (wu~ wu~ wu~ wu)

Charging up, I'm searching for you right now...did you notice?

We shouldn't keep secrets from each other, right? Right?
It's embarrassing to call it friendship, though
I'll always be by your side, right? Right?

"I like this!" 'I don't.' Huh? We disagree?
It's fine to have different opinions
There's nothing wrong with that (We're pure girls!)
This is our declaration of purity! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

First and foremost is what's right in front of us
Right? (Yeah!) Right? (Yeah!) Let's prepare our route!

It's boring to always feel safe and secure, right?
In the end I want to try something new; shall we? Shall we?
Friendship is like an ally of adventure
My feelings won't be enough without it, so shall we? Shall we?

"I'll come!" 'I won't." Huh? You don't know?
It's okay to not be able to decide
Everyone's right in the end (We're pure girls!)
This is our declaration of purity! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

"Invite me if you’re going somewhere"
I’ve been practicing for this; now I just need to call out to you
These conversations are impossible; I'm getting flustered

Just imagining it (Hot!! my summer time)
A bold me (Please love me, ah!)
I know that nothing will start with me just looking at you, so
Give me the courage to take one more step

LOVE!? shines in my heart with a sparkle
My yearning for love; an unsuppressible passion
LOVE!? I think that’s your fault
Even though I wish you would notice it, ah, I still can't say it!

A special relationship is still a mystery
I want to know when it'll come to be
Is it after we call each other by our names?
Or after we start walking arm in arm?

The summer nights (Hot!! my summer night)
When the number of my sighs increase (Please touch me, ah!)
Nothing bad will happen if I just keep looking
But it hurts to take a step back

RED!! Flickers the traffic light, we can't move forward
Love is dangerous, but that's why I'm so curious, of this passion
RED!! Your wink that's like sunlight is giving me a push
My lips open and yet,  "Hey...nevermind!"

(Hot!!)
(My summer)
(Please love me)

(What's this feeling?)
(Tell me!)

My summer LOVE!? shines in my heart with a sparkle
My yearning for love; an unsuppressible passion
LOVE!? I think that’s your fault
Even though I wish you would notice it, ah, I still can't say it!/nuoy ekil I
You know that, right?
I like you (I love you)

With something other than effort, if searching for the things that can be done
Should I use the power of prayer? Or even magic?
It's worth a try right?
So closing my eyes gently, stroking your cheek
I want to convey the miracle of us two, aiming for your heart

Trying to call out to you with a louder voice might be good
But rather than a loud voice, I'm more familiar with love!

Take a look at the upside-down of the upside-down
"Like" is always the reverse of "hate"
Cute but hateful, that's right
That's just a so-called "love"
Take a look at the upside-down of the upside-down
I can't just say "I like you"
Muttering enigmatic words, that's right
Hurry up and notice!

uoy ekil I
You know that, right?
I like you (I love you)

A future better than expected, that's what I covet
Is it tenacity, or just being a sore loser?
I think I won't give up
Yet you won't change from how you always are
These feelings you show me are a mystery, we have to clarify them

After all during the times I want to meet, even trying to call out won't reach you
That's why this spell that makes you come to meet me, this is my trump card!

If a mistake of a mistake is fine,
"Yes" is probably "no" right
Holding you dear but feeling sinful, that's right
That's also probably just love
If a mistake of a mistake is fine,
"Yes!" is easier for me to want to say
Enigmatic words are easy, that's right
I'll understand in ten seconds

Take a look at the upside-down of the upside-down
"Like" is always the reverse of "hate"
Cute but hateful, that's right
That's just a so-called "love"
Take a look at the upside-down of the upside-down
I can't just say "I like you"
Muttering enigmatic words, that's right
Hurry up and notice!

uoy ekil I
You know that, right?
I like you (I love you)/nBecause it's a dream that's not like a dream
Shut your eyes and stay forever in the land of dreams
Oh! Baby I want to trap your pure eyes
Don't be afraid, don't be afraid, Falling love!!

Stop playing games, come here seriously
Princess this and princess that, I'm tired of hearing that
Oh! Baby I want to be kidnapped violently with passion
Don't get lost, don't get lost, Falling love!!

It's amazing, how our hearts are attracted beyond anything
Show me the flame of love, let it illuminate me

Paradiso!!
I want to try winning tonight's adventure with its dangerous rules
It's a premonition we'll find the best of us through the worst
Paradiso!!
Tonight's adventure is an unexpected Fantasy with dangerous rules
Maybe I'm falling in love, falling in love
"Falling in love is fine too"... I won't let you say that

(Oh! Baby Paradiso yeah!! Oh! Baby Paradiso yeah!!)

Because it's a dream that's not like a dream
I'm a seductress leading you on
Shut your eyes and stay forever in the land of dreams
A Dream that will never reach anyone's eyes

Always seeking each other, wanting our hearts to become one
Show me the flame of love, let it illuminate me

Mio amore!!
I want to harshly steal it all with the smile of a goddess
I want to give you the best memories through the worst
Mio amore!!
I want to harshly hug it all with the smile of a goddess
Maybe I'm becoming strange, becoming strange
"Becoming strange is fine too"... Maybe I want to let you say that

Relax even more! Your body and your mind too
Get released from this world right now
Hey, do you know me?
I wonder if you can become a fish

Relax, just float up and gaze into the distance
The sky that you're familiar with is beautiful
Ah, let's just dissolve into this clear water

The waves ebbs and flows in order to sing
My tanned skin feels nice and cool
If you close your eyes because it's too bright,
All your worries will disappear

All the fishes! Continually swim into
All the fishes! The free future
The fickle dream swaying in the waves
Won't be caught, let's chase after them!
All the fishes! Swim easily into
All the fishes! The free future
Holding nothing but hopes and wishes
Tomorrow, let's play in this sea too!/nI thought I knew you better than anyone else
But was it just an illusion? I lost my love....

There's a reason that we met
One day you said that, didn't you?
I nodded as you looked me in the eyes
Our futures becoming separate was impossible

If we return (But to where?) Where would we return to?
All the times our feelings passed each other by, I don't understand

More than your words, I believed in the heat of your fingers as you touched me, but
Why did you say farewell in such a cold voice...?
I thought I knew you better than anyone else
But was it just an illusion? 
That's right... I'm a fool...

We always liked the same things
Was that just a coincidence?
It's too late, you're this dear to me
Your heart's separated from mine, and I can't reach it, but

Embrace me (your scent) in this familiar fragrance
I want to stay immersed, as my tears quietly fall

Even right before my eyes, you're distant from me
Why can you smile so peacefully...?
I thought you'd never change
But when the illusion ended, I lost my love...

Talking to you normally is too painful
I'm like this, (strength) I don't have, please understand
Even right before my eyes, you're distant from me

More than your words, I believed in the heat of your fingers as you touched me, but
Why did you say farewell in such a cold voice...?
I thought I knew you better than anyone else
But was it just an illusion?
That's right.... I want to go back... to how we were that day..../nSetting off anew
Is always a wonderful thing
Even though we're parting ways
A smile, I have to smile

Really, I want to chase after you
But I'll see you off
Because next time we meet, I want to show you
How much I've grown, so I'll keep working hard here

I swear I won't forget
All the things you've taught me
The day we meet again in the future isn't far

Graduation bye bye's, "I won't cry," I say, as I wave my hand
Congratulations!
Every beginning has an end they say
But y'know, the reverse is true too
Endings lead to new beginnings
Congratulations, congratulations!
Doesn't that sound better? Definitely...

A new journey
Will call on everyone 
For us too, who saw you off
The time will come when we're seen off, isn't that right?

We want to greet you with our heads held high
And that's why, we'll forge on
Where should we aim our goal? Let's decide now

Graduation bye bye's, are these cherry blossoms? They're raining down
Congratulations!
They say every meeting is meaningful
And that's because I've come to love you
Our bond was born from it
Congratulations, congratulations!
My longing for you will never disappear

Today is graduation, bye bye, the cherry blossoms are raining down
Congratulations!
They say every meeting is meaningful
And that's because I've come to love you
Our bond was born from it
Congratulations, congratulations!
My longing for you will never disappear
Forever, forever.../nWas the sky this same color, when it all began?
Since then I've looked up at it time and again, comparing the differences

While wandering aimless, wondering whether there was something I could do, I ended up here
And thanks to you, I really could do it -- I'm grateful we met

Sharing our happiness, and frustration too, gives us the power to head towards tomorrow
Since I came running all this way, I have no regrets at all

Rather than wallow in nostalgia
Let's give each other a smile and say, 'we'll meet again!'
We'll set 'farewell' aside, until 'maybe someday' comes
I want to cherish this joy, and have fun together with everyone
'Let's bid farewell farewell!'
A silly urge, but I found myself wanting to say it...

You're in my heart; that won't ever change
I wonder what it is that'll change, then? The passage of time, and our wishes?

At the familiar road's end, the season's light shimmers
And I can already see them in your eyes -- your plans for what's ahead

Leaving all sadness behind, my chest swells with love
I'll always keep running after you; just promise we'll be together, that's all I need

Those words have been repeated so many times, I won't say them
It's painful to, so I won't say them
'Farewell' means 'we'll meet again someday' -- we'll make it mean that
All of us wanting to cherish this joy and have fun together, let's say it together:
'Farewell to farewell!' It's a daring 'Hello!' for the future

Those words have been repeated so many times, I won't say them
It's painful to, so I won't say them
'Farewell' means 'we'll meet again someday' -- we'll make it mean that

Rather than wallow in nostalgia
Let's give each other a smile and say, 'we'll meet again!'
We'll set 'farewell' aside, until 'maybe someday' comes
I want to cherish this joy, and have fun together with everyone
'Farewell to farewell!'
A silly urge, but I found myself wanting to say it...
It might be a good thing to say, after all!/nYour wishes, the stars are watching
Shining gently, because they are watching

Even if I write a tear-colored diary
I'm whispering about the future beside the window

(Being held by) the quiet night,
Anybody (becomes dear)
Everyone is doing their best
Even if we disagree, it's okay

Holy night, even though it's the holy day
I waver
It's painful being alone
Holy night, the words of my prayer
Suddenly spilled out
Together with you, I wish for happiness

Picture your dreams in the sky
Picture a free future

A wonderful person (is who I want to be)
Whoever it is (I want to forgive)
Everyone is doing their best to better themselves
Even if we don't understand each other, it's okay

Holy star, oh, holy light
It'll always be there
It looks like you're not alone
Holy star, the words of my prayer
Quietly pour out
That joy will be in your heart

Holy star, oh, holy light
It'll always be there
It looks like you're not alone
Holy star, the words of my prayer
Quietly pour out
Joy shines and makes your heart become a star
Together with you, I wish for happiness

Holy night, Holy star with you.../nI wanna be told I'm the best, this is serious; We gotta go!

Dreams are dreams, but they can't easily be reached
Let's aim for a special something, shall we?
For that sake, I won't cry
Who's my enemy? My enemy is the shadow of my weak self

You understand that, right?
Weak hearts are forbidden (I won't allow them)
I feel it! Tightly; The place where I now stand
SELF CONTROL!!

I want (One more chance time!)
Everyone to tell me I'm the best! (I wanna be told I'm the best!)
Dance now! Dance now!
I have decided (One more chance time!)
I'll make you tell me I'm the best! (This is serious, this isn't a game!)
Dance now! Dance now!

Let's aim more for that distant light, Baby! I want us to fly together more, Baby!
Even though my fingertips tremble, don't look
What's important is SELF CONTROL!!

May it be love or passion, I don't wanna lose my cool
Because I've already reached for loneliness
Now, shut up and move, Breakdown! Then, Break out from the night of momentum!
I understand it already; Loneliness is something you aim for yourself
Now, I'll bet everything on it; I've decided I'll keep looking forward
Who's my enemy? My enemy is the dread of my strong self

You understand that, right?
I've got to throw away these powerful fears (These fears... I'll throw away!)
I promise to you, I'll bring you to a wonderful place

No one (Best life, best mind!)
Can be as strong as me, right? (Convince yourself that you're the strongest!)
Dance now! Dance now!
There is (Best life, best mind!)
No one to replace me as the strongest (You don't want to be written off, right?)
Dance now! Dance now!

That unfading light, Baby! Is definitely calling for me, Baby!
Repressing my sighs of hesitation, I've prepared
And I will continue to run, in this SELF CONTROL!!

Convincing myself that I'm the strongest, to the summit, We gotta go!

CONTROL yeah!
Dreams are dreams, I realized I can't end them
Quickly, quickly voice it, erase all of your complaints
Dance now! Dance now!
CONTROL yeah!
Convince, convince yourself of your strength; Crush your weakness everyday
Bring out, bring out your Energy; Today will be today's evolution!
Dance now! Dance now!

I want (One more chance time!)
Everyone to tell me I'm the best! (I wanna be told I'm the best!)
Dance now! Dance now!
I have decided (One more chance time!)
I'll make you tell me I'm the best! (This is serious, this isn't a game!)
Dance now! Dance now!

Let's aim more for that distant light, Baby! I want us to fly together more, Baby!
Even though my fingertips tremble, don't look
What's important is SELF CONTROL!!
I will continue to run, in this SELF CONTROL!!/nDoing things firmly
The me today
I'll throw my weak heart into the night sky
Doing things firmly
The me today won't flee, I can run into the darkness

While regretting, we'll pass through this
Don't quit, there's definitely a different path

The light I once wanted to see, the light that dwells within my chest
I realise that now is that time
While feeling a burning awakening
Light is pouring down, the light that dwells within everyone
Why don't we believe in our smiles and advance?

Still existing
The me today
Wants to become strong, so as to stand by you
Still existing
The me today can win, I can seize tomorrow

Even though I can't say it, I was happy
That there existed someone who knew my loneliness

I wanted power, power to protect my dream
We're still in time, let's rise up
The light of dawn illuminates us
The power that can revive, a power that protects everyone
So I smiled close to you

The light I once wanted to see, the light that dwells within my chest
I realise that now is that time
While feeling a burning awakening
Light is pouring down, the light that dwells within everyone
Let's believe in our smiles and advance

I wanted power, power to protect my dream
We're still in time, let's rise up
The light of dawn illuminates us
The power that can revive, a power that protects everyone
So I smiled close to you/nNot recognizing each other even when we pass by
When we've become adults
Will this all become nostalgia?... I was thinking about that

Because you've always been by my side
I took that for granted
I thought our everyday life of troubles and laughter will surely continue

This feeling of wanting to preserve this fun moment
It's the first time I'm feeling that

Not recognizing each other even when we pass by
I can't imagine a time when you and I become adults
After all, we'll always be together

Though we can't see it, we really have been maturing bit by bit
From the place where we buried seeds
Tiny leaves are starting to sing

I finally noticed that somewhere along the way
The changing seasons had painted the town a new color

I tried calling you within the light filtering through the trees
But the wind unexpectedly drowned me out 
For just a moment, the scenery wavered into sadness

I'm just imagining it right, we're still the same as always
Playfully running around until I feel like I'm about to trip
Wait, wait, are you stopping somewhere on the way home?

Not recognizing each other even when we pass by
I can't imagine a time when you and I become adults
After all, we'll always be together

I tried calling you within the light filtering through the trees
But the wind unexpectedly drowned me out 
For just a moment, the scenery wavered into sadness
The scenery wavered into sadness/nWhen you think you want something more
Take a look at that dark staircase
In the place where light doesn't shine, a door is opening (You need me)

Try tempting me with those strong-scented eyes of yours 
This night overflowing with hidden desire might be stimulating
Now, what do you want to do?

My shadow wants to swallow up
This dream of yours
It's okay to fall in love, a trap was set with these sighs
It's probably taking effect now, aren't you numb?

Not everyone can see it
Only you were selected
A door that opens in that place where you refused light (You want me)

A spell is the number of kisses I'd like to try someday
An impure night in which we ask "what if", will be stimulating
Now, what shall we do?

You and I conflict like two sides of a coin
Changing into love
If it is a beautiful lie, it should be forgiven
That's why you also whisper words of love

Surely I can meet you before that door disappears.
Yes, I can hear your footsteps, 
Now's the moment!

My shadow wants to swallow up
This dream of yours
It's okay to fall in love, a trap was set with these sighs
It's probably taking effect now, aren't you numb?

You and I conflict like two sides of a coin
Changing into love
If it is a beautiful lie, it should be forgiven
That’s why you and I both whisper words of a fantastical love

Oh baby Shadow gate！It's okay to fall in love
Oh baby Shadow gate！It's okay to fall in love/nShangri-La on stage!
Shangri-La from stage, on stage!

Your heart knows, that the unstoppable present is everything
Freedom that feels like sprouting wings, was always our goal

My heart is clamoring; its throbbing has long gone past the peak

You suddenly noticed…Noticed that I want to see you
Waiting to go home after school’s unbearable

Leaning within the shadows of the trees along the road alone
Even if I look down and count just the footsteps it’s no good…No, no good!

Feel the fate (Is what I wish for)
This is the first time the uneasiness in my chest has made me want to cry

Unknown Love*Teach me Love
I’m inexperienced, I dizzily Cry
Looking at someone this way
Have I changed so much?
Unknown Love*Teach me Love
I’m a coward yet I can’t stop
When I attempted to go a little beyond my limits
A wind blew, I want to be swept away by your gale

My heart throbbed…Throbbed from my hastening heartbeat
The curiosity’s hotter than the pain-inducing fever

Get closer to me, I want you to call out to me
Still not knowing even each other’s names, I hate it…Hate, hate it!

If I believe in fate (It’ll come true)
We shouldn’t need things like words, Let it start with our eyes

Childish Heart*Opening Heart
Am I purehearted? There’s still more to go mind
This feeling of love is a yet unknown adventure
How will I change?
Childish Heart*Opening Heart
Hold me and take me to the moon
Forgive me for all my wishes
My desire to see your dreams is greater than the number of stars

Unknown Love*Teach me Love
I’m inexperienced, I dizzily Cry
Looking at someone this way
Have I changed so much?
Unknown Love*Teach me Love
I’m a coward yet I can’t stop
When I attempted to go a little beyond my limits

I can't stay the way I've been up until now! I would hate to!

I've been thinking that I want to feel my heart flutter
So when I met you 
I thought that you could be the one, but was I wrong?
(No, I won't believe that!)

I'll share my fun times with you, but what about the sad times?
Even though I wanted to meet with you tonight, I don't know where you are!

Now I'm angry
I hope you won't notice that I'm so feisty like this
But now I feel like attacking you!

Look at me, look at me, seriously, I don't mind getting hurt
Normal conversations are so boring
I just want to get to know you
Don't play around with me, you've sparked a light in my eyes
(I yearn for you) with this unknown passion
Embrace me, embrace me, I want to love as more than a little girl

Those eyes that looked at me were sort of adult-like
Though they tend to be misunderstood
It's disappointing when you say that too, get a hold of yourself!

Saying "Everything is so wonderful!" only exists in imaginary worlds
So let's at least long for a thrill

Come here, come right here by my side, I want to see a forbidden dream
It's boring if it's not that passionate
I want to touch you more deeply
I don't want to be just admired, I want you so bad
This dangerous passion (can't be stopped)
I won't extinguish it, get rid of it, I don't need to seem like a little girl anymore

Thinking by myself, wishing to myself, of the things I can't do by myself
Is it bad that I want to do them with you?
Think to myself, wishing to myself, of the things I can't do by myself
I want to believe this means I've fallen in love so

Look at me, look at me, seriously, I don't mind getting hurt
Normal conversations are so boring
I just want to get to know you
Don't play around with me, you've sparked a light in my eyes
(I yearn for you) with this unknown passion
Embrace me, embrace me, I want to love as more than a little girl

I miss you, so the next step is surely
Wanting to touch you, are you like a little boy?
I miss you, so the next step is surely
You too touching love as more than a little girl/nIs it starting...?


Nobody, nobody, is aware
For the sake of this love to be born again
I have now become a quivering butterfly

The flowers' fragrance is frightening, intoxicatingly sweet
My heart melts... I can't explain it
Wait, don't discover me this quickly
It's strange (It's strange) It's strange (It's strange) A strangely hot sigh
Can be a little bit passionate

Fluttering about in a dream, the romantic within me
Is feeling lost upon its first awakening
Somehow it isn't bad
Fluttering about in a dream, it's all embarrassing
But that's no good
Come on, you have no choice but to try and fly

I want to watch this fluttering dream, this heart pounding dream


How about a fragile, fragile love
The flower buds are enticing me
But I still can't move my weak wings

Being merry and trying a sip of the nectar, I thought
The cherry blossom's trap... I can't resist it
Wait, haven't I met you somewhere before?
It's weird (It's weird) It's weird (It's weird) that disagreements are bitter
Yet unexpectedly passionate

Feeling it makes my heart throb, I've finally become a romantic
The excitement of having a crush for the first time
Isn't bad in the slightest
Feeling it makes my heart throb, the butterflies disturbing my heart
Please don't hurt them
Ah, when I tried to fly, what would become of me?
When I fell in love...
Softly holding me
This dream is feeling Romantic


The season of beginning (The season of beginning)
Is a little bit passionate, unexpectedly passionate

Fluttering about in a dream, the romantic within me
Is feeling lost upon its first awakening
Somehow it isn't bad
Fluttering about in a dream, it's all embarrassing
But that's no good
Come... once you fall in love, you have no choice but to try and fly

I want to watch this fluttering dream, this heart pounding dream/nTo the extent that the words don’t come out
I have kept on running
Because to understand, I’ll ask as it is
“It was truly remarkable, wasn't it?”
It’s fine to put on a composed act
Because no one is watching anymore
Having a worn-out face is fine
I will embrace you tightly

However, at this moment, both our gazes met
We just cuddle ever so softly
I don’t care about the meaning at all, but always
This sweetness will not disappear from my heart


If people did not rely on each other
Working hard would become a habit, right?
But just for a bit, I stop to a halt
I feel like it wouldn't be so bad
I close my eyes and see a floating face
Because it can’t be me, you know
During the times we aren't together, I am also thinking about you 
I want to embrace you tightly

A long time ago, “I like you and yet…”
I said that, but now, I still feel the same way 
I never ask why it is like this
I want to convey this sweetness from my heart


During the times we aren't together, I am also thinking about you 
If I spend time enjoyably, it would be nice 
It’s fine to put on a composed act
I want to embrace you tightly

However, at this moment, both our gazes met
We just cuddle ever so softly
I don’t care about the meaning at all, but always
This sweetness will not disappear from my heart

A long time ago, “I like you and yet…”
I said that, but now, I still feel the same way 
I never ask why it is like this
I want to convey this sweetness from my heart

Silent tonight wow
Silent tonight for you…
Silent tonight wow
Silent tonight for you.../nWhere did you come from?
"From far away"
You seemed to answer, with out answering
You were in a world that I know nothing of
These are what the color of my sighs makes me think

It truly was a painful oath
But my voice sings of tomorrow with a smile

If I just hold the certain things in my heart
Things will work out somehow
Why is it that I can say that so easily?
Everyone wishes for courage
I know that it is how I feel
But people tend to waver


Where are you aiming for?
"Far away"
Your answer pointed to the sky
With you, I want to talk about places we haven't yet seen
The beating of our dancing hearts in the future

Soon we'll set out from here for what's next
That smile of yours (has no hesitation)
I'm jealous that it is so brilliant

Since I want my dreams to come true
It's important to never give up
Why is it that I can say that so earnestly?
If I just receive some courage I'll be fine
From those hot feelings of yours
That I've received, I'm passionate too


It truly was a painful oath
But my voice sings of tomorrow with a smile

If I just hold the certain things in my heart
Things will work out somehow
Where I go I will keep on saying that
If I just receive some courage I'll be fine
It is not just me who has received
Those passionate feelings of yours
But the world too is burning with them/nThis feeling, it's strange, isn't it?
It's almost as though it came fluttering down from the sky
The color of this special season fills me with excitement

From the moment we met,
The melody of my heart has been ringing with premonitions
It can’t be stopped, it won’t be stopped -- why?

Ring out
Shall I name this heart-rending pain "Snow halation"?
I can’t wait for our feelings to resonate; it’s frustrating, but it’s a pure-hearted devotion called love
Even in this mild fever, I can’t hesitate
I'll accept the courage to dive in; it's about to start!


Without a sound, nor a sign
Our fate changes silently
At the thought of the coming future, my heartbeat quickens

When you feel troubled
I’ll come running right away, wanting to hug you tightly,
Wherever you are, no matter where, I'll Fly high!

Hurry up
Before I knew it, my true emotions grew too large to contain
It's painful to never do more than dream of it
I want you to be mine!
I don't want to be bewildered by your gentle eyes
Accept all my love for you as it is, Please!


Ring out
Shall I name this heart-rending pain "Snow halation"?
I can’t wait for our feelings to resonate; It’s frustrating, but it’s a pure-hearted devotion called love
Even in this mild fever, I can’t hesitate
I'll accept the courage to dive in; it's about to start!/nThree, two, one, zero! Here's my intro
Please look at me; I'm completely serious
My thrilling beauty will win, without fail

I whisper gentle words
I'm not just pretending to be cute
I have to coldly, strongly protect
those precious to me, and those weak

Who am I, yes? You've grown curious, yes?
Then it might just be love
Knowing secrets lie hidden in my heart,
What will you do about that?
It's soldier game
Will you ask about them next time we meet?

Three, two, one, zero! Onto the next battle strategy
Please look at me; I'm completely serious
Receive my signal and the future will be yours

Sweeter than a smile
Are tears brought about from a lie
Hiding transience and fragileness,
You're someone precious, someone weak

You'll come with me, yes? You've grown curious about my touch, yes?
Then it's already love
Since you're someone I must meet in battle someday,
That might just be your reason
I'm soldier heart
I won't lose, okay? It's soldier game

(Come on!)

It's a duel now!
Who am I, yes? You've grown curious, yes?
Then it might just be love
Knowing secrets lie hidden in my heart,
what will you do about that?

You'll come with me, yes? You've grown curious about my touch, yes?
Then it's already love
Since you're someone I must meet in battle someday,
That might just be your reason
It's soldier game
Though we've met again, I'm soldier heart/nThe wind is calling; the trees are rustling
Sakura colors dance in this season
My memories are fluttering once again; ah, they have descended

Do you remember the day of our encounter
Lately it's been burning stronger
This feeling of uneasiness from the start has continued till now


Let's make a promise
Even if we become separated someday
Let's meet here once again
And watch the beautiful flowers bloom

One day in the rain,One day in the shine
These flowing thoughts don't disappear
In the same place, we could see tomorrow
One day in the rain,One day in the shine
I hold on to these overflowing feelings
The path we were following, led to our unfolding dream


In the shaking distance, the flaming greenery
While drawing summer's pulsating rainbow
The echoing voice was throbbing; ah, how exciting

Being together forever, isn't that nice
Whispering that is embarrassing
This neverending fun, I want to continue believing in it

Let's make a wish
For a future even the stars in the sky do not know
We'll definitely check here for each other
The strength of our unchanging bond

Someday of my life,Someday of my love
Let's laugh without sadness
Let's put in what's left and smile again tomorrow
Someday of my life,Someday of my love
A lot of my feelings are welling up
The hope that was given to us, gave us our unfolding dream


One day in the rain,One day in the shine
These flowing thoughts don't disappear
In the same place, we could see tomorrow

Someday of my life,Someday of my love
Let's laugh without sadness
Let's put in what's left and smile again tomorrow
Someday of my life,Someday of my love
A lot of my feelings are welling up
The hope that was given to us, gave us our unfolding dream/nWhen things don’t go well
When I start to tear up
Chewing my lip, I wish, “Let tomorrow be clear!”

The two hearts, unconnected
But seemingly connected

A ship crosses over the sunset
So that it may carry away my worries,
I can still keep going. Shall I say this to the vanishing waves?
Look, I’m alright now, let’s run home
I want to tell you once we’re home
That I want to do interesting things...

When we start to move (it’ll be fun)
But we’ll often run into walls (what should we do?)
It doesn’t matter whatever we may think, “Let tomorrow be clear!”

Even still, today ends, and we face the next day
Are you crying again?
It’s fine! I’ll recover
Faster this time

The moon brings along sleep
As if gently caressing me
I can still keep going, I muttered softly, alone
Look, I’m alright! Maybe I’ll wake up early
I have to tell you
That I want to do new things

The moon brings along sleep
As if gently caressing me
I can still keep going, I muttered softly, alone
Look, I’m alright! Maybe I’ll wake up early
I want to do new things
I’ll have to tell you once I wake up/nSo... With courage, we will make our dreams come true
With an indomitable spirit, let's run toward the future

A strong, strong wish
Always guides us on our way
We're not going to compromise on things we love
We'll seize whatever time we have left

We won't settle for fond memories
Let's dash with all our might
(Chance for me! Chance for you!)

So... Once you've embraced your dreams, look up
You'll find big changes to your world
So... With courage, we will make our dreams come true
With an indomitable spirit, let's run toward the future

In the midst of our burning anticipation
Let's sing happily
Try to feel the same feelings
Enjoy our limited time

The passion that can no longer be stopped has won
Rather than regret, we'll try to keep running
The sky that we suddenly see, it is so blue
It's alright; we'll run without giving up
(Dance with me! Dance with you!)

Yes... That day I dreamed of seeing everyone's smiles
Because I saw your smile, I laughed
Yes... That day we painted the same dream
Our sparkling eyes believe in tomorrow

(Hi! Hi!　Until the very end, we'll run through!)

So... Once you've embraced your dreams, look up
You'll find big changes to your world
So... With courage, we will make our dreams come true
With an indomitable spirit, let's run toward the future

Yes... That day I dreamed of seeing everyone's smiles
Because I saw your smile, I laughed
Yes... That day we painted the same dream
Our sparkling eyes believe in tomorrow
With an indomitable spirit, we'll believe in tomorrow

This encounter is a miracle
Never forget, this moment is ours/nDays are shining, If we work hard just like this!
Days are shining, If we work hard just like this!
Days are shining, and sparkling!

I don't want to return all alone, I'm standing by the roadside
Come find me, I've been thinking all about myself (I'm lonely girl)

I've slowly come to understand, that being afraid is no good
Tell me what you feel about that day (ever since that day)

The tension persists, there's just too much I can't get used to
This awkward me (surely)
Is definitely overthinking it! I'm definitely caring too much about it!

Right now that's all just funny stories, it seems we've become way stronger than we thought
Lots of things happened, right? Getting mad, crying, and keeping busy
The memories are piling up within this pure white notebook
I want to write a small "Thank you" on the cover
Someday... Someday!

Days are shining, Today I feel I should do my best!
Days are shining, Steadily!

Possibilities and impossibilities, once they're entangled they can't be unraveled
Having become someone who gives no ground, I couldn't find a way out (I'm puny girl)

In order to clear the fog, I'll turn it all into new feelings
At the time I decided to overcome all these troubles (The time of decision)

The wind is flowing, towards a different world
This transforming me (and so)
Definitely led the way! On the road to this place!

That's why the funny stories won't end, everyone seems to have gotten stronger
Lots of things happened, right? It was an unforgettable episode
From a pure white notebook it became an entire book
What will happen on the last page?
We don't know... We still don't know...


Maybe we're stressing over it too much! Maybe we're caring too much about it!

Right now that's all just funny stories, it seems we've become way stronger
Lots of things happened, right? Getting mad, crying, and keeping busy
The memories are piling up within this pure white notebook
I want to write a small "Thank you" on the cover
Someday... Someday!

Days are shining

Days are shining, If we work hard just like this!
Days are shining, and sparkling!/nFrom here on, you and I will go left and right
We will each choose our own future
We will no longer be able to see each other

While sharing our many dreams with each other
How quickly the seasons have passed

It's graduation, isn't it?
Now that we are here
Why is that we've let go of each other's hands?
Somewhere along the way
I feel that we grew up a little
That's probably why - it is a path that all must follow

Before signaling our farewell
Both you and I
Will swim through our memories
Will realize we can no longer see each other

The joy of meeting you carried a sadness
But I'm not saddened by it

Though it's our graduation
Don't forget me, keep holding me
Someday this throbbing will be so nostalgic
But it won't be until much later
That I'll understand there won't be another
Today I just go far off, and tomorrow a different road waits for me

While sharing our many dreams with each other
How quickly the seasons have passed

It's graduation, isn't it?
Now that we are here
Why is it that we've let go of each other's hands?
Somewhere along the way
I feel that we grew up a little
That's probably why - it is a path that all must follow
Is it not...?
Is it not...?
Is it not...?/nThe fallen leaves being swept away by the wind; the light watching over the night
Where can you be at this time

If we're friends that's great but, if we're lovers that's just terrible
The pendulum of hesitation can't be stopped

The words of "I like you"
Flowing out of my wet eyes is a secret

My present... future... they exist in you
My wishes are bursting out of me
I won't voice them out but because they won't disappear
They're knocking on the door
I want to open up... but... it's frightening
To open up is frightening
So as not to awake from this still unseen dream, and I'm scared
The Terrible of stars

In the eastern sky there is a faint sign of tomorrow's coming
The today I spent thinking about you is ending

If it's a coincidence I wonder if it'll be great, if it's suddenly it'll probably be terrible
This excitement of wanting to tell you can't be stopped

"I like you" is just painful
When my sadness overflowed, I decided

My heart's present... future... if it's with you
It wants to become one with you
If I don't say it, it can't be conveyed
Don't throw away the key
If... I want to try and open up... I'll have to step out
I want to open up my self
Just that if I lament for love only, nothing will change


If we're friends that's great but, if we're lovers that's just terrible

You gonna see the starlight

Let this body heat, alright??
Even if you wake up from a dream
A world that remembers

I will let you say besides me
I cannot feel, nor think anything
No.1 in absolute charm

Fly Fly to this stage
Come on, the lighting Starlight
(Tonight veiled by Neon)
The spotlight that colors up to the maximum
(Oh, shout)

This isn't enough, raise the volume
The high resonance is addictive
Raise it as I yearn for it
Fly! Fly! Call me
The starlight dancing in time

Lured by a sweet voice
I've chosen this myself, I cannot turn back
I will let someone else be the captive
I cannot feel, nor think anything
No.1 in pleasing feeling

I will let you say besides me
I feel nothing I can not think
No.1 in absolute charm

Fly high to that image
Yes! Enchant the starlight
(Just the guided tonight)
The boldly-colored spotlight (Oh, feel it)

Fly Fly to this stage Come on Come on Starlight

Raising the leaves of our troubles from seeds
Let's put an end to picking them!
Let's spread the seeds of something more beautiful, that sounds like a dream

If you walk along the streets, you'll hear the invitation of the changing seasons
My feet are involuntarily dancing a new beat, towards where you are

It's contradictory to count your anxieties while seeking excitement

Please tell me what I have to do to make it feel fine

In times that seem like they can change, and even times that don't, I can feel it so
This time round, this time round
Let's open the door from zero to one; It's a time I want to change
Maybe the future from here onwards will remain a mystery
ZERO to ONE, ZERO to ONE, ZERO to ONE…STEP!
ZERO to ONE, Steppin' my heart!

Even lost flowers wait in hope,
for the light of day when they'll bloom!
So shall we become beautiful flowers, that look like a dream

While rushing towards tomorrow, I want to spend today enjoying the present

Please tell me what I have to do to make it feel firm

I won't wait for you...Love!!

I found you!
Your eyes looked lonely
Your heartbeat's calling out, saying "take me into your hands"
Feeling so much heat but calm on the outside, I can enjoy that
Hold down those growing feelings

Quietly, collecting information about you
Certainly, there's value in a sensitive mind
Stepping up in the background, the thrill is unbearable
Because once I've chosen my target, you can't run away. You can't run away, my target!!

I want to feel special
I want to steal you away
I won't wait for you...Love!!

I want to see
Your frightened face
I'm sure I'm making an awful face when I scheme about it
What I want to get, is that heart of yours
Fragile and uncertain kindness

To you, who loves quiet and solitude
I'm firing an undeniable brilliant light
I want to make you mine before you can realize
My target is decided, you can't run away. You can't run away, my target!!

The sun's shining and beckoning the future

Look to the sky, look together, if we catch a miracle

Pure feelings of excitement, point to the future
Come, let's fly, you fly too, forge ahead to tomorrow

Strong feelings (Because they were born)
I've made up my mind and I'll do it (I was so happy)
Right here with everyone (More and more)

Get together at the usual place
I say happy holiday, happy holiday
We talk about whatever we want today, Happy time

The rumored chocolate (Delicious!)
I tried lining them up (Melting)
Love is bittersweet (Together)
So, So, It’s sweet and bitter

Now is everything
Yet I easily worried about the past
It’s weird, Yeah, It’s not like me so it’s weird

I wanted you to listen for a minute to the seeds of my worries
It’s laughable when put into words
I wonder if I can feed them to the birds as snacks

I know happy holiday, happy holiday
It’ll be fun so get together
I say happy holiday, happy holiday
With everyone’s voices, shiny day
I know happy holiday, happy holiday
My heart’s bursting open honestly
I say happy holiday, happy holiday
I love you so it’s great, Happy time

Rainbow-colored macaroon (Gimme!)
Mouthful of magic (Gonna disappear)
Easily-broken love (An adventure)
But you know, But you know, I want more

This is now
Dispel the gloom of ordinary days
What? I chewed on it, Is it really like us?

With a superb smile of course I can’t lose
The energy sleeping at the bottom of my body
Unleashed my enthusiastic style

We are dancing everyday, dancing everyday
It’s refreshing moving so cheerfully
You are dancing everyday, dancing everyday
It’s coming to everybody, sunny day
We are dancing everyday, dancing everyday
Let’s bust out into chitchat with honest expressions
You are dancing everyday, dancing everyday
I love you so it’s great, Dancing girls

Choco-Choco-Chocolate (Delicious!)
Maca-maca-macaron (Isn't it delicious?)
Love’s melting (Wanna give it a shot?)
So, So, It’s sweet and bitter/nWalking with just a trot in our step
(Trot, trot)
Feels like something is missing
(Trot, trot, trot)
So with a big call (Yes Sir)
Change the tempo to that SunSun march!

With high spirits, through their drowsiness
So many different people come to gather
When did our hearts come so close together?
Now change to a gallop!

Go! We gotta go!
The world is always changing
Go! We need a new map!
We still don't know what tomorrow holds (holds) holds (holds)
Too many things, so let's start on our journey!
Marching with you, if our march is heard it's a sign!

Even if we catch up, with our hearts beating
(ba-dump, ba-dump)
Soon I'll want to see even more again
(ba-dump, ba-dump, ba-dump)
I want to taste (yes, sir!)
A different kind of dream, and SunSun march some more!

If we're brave and get lost
Let's struggle through with a crude smile
"Somehow we'll do it" are the only words you need
When you find yourself stuck

Shine! Be shining!
Even you carry the wish to fly
Shine! The future isn't set
I have hopes that it'll be fun (it will) it will (it will)
There's so much hope, I know now
Marching with you, our march will resound
Go! It's time to go!

Stop trotting, we gotta go fast!
But at a tempo just right for you
I woke up with my heart beating, it's time to shine!
Keep going, keep going, into the distance

Go! We gotta go!
The world is always changing
Go! We need a new map
To the future we don't know of yet
Shine! Be shining!
Even you carry the wish to fly
Shine! The future isn't set
I have hopes that it'll be fun (it will) it will (it will). So much hope

I know that now, and marching with you
Our march will resound, so we gotta go
Go! It's time to go!
Go! Go! Go!/nNow, where will our smiles take us?
Think of where you want to go
Hurry, let's go!

Having fun could be the key to using your heart
Brush away all of the things you don't like
Yes, let's go!

Look up to the sky, and your tears will seem to fade away
Come on, come on, come on, here's a hint!

We've discovered treasures right here and now
Lots of them; they're everyone's smiles
The treasures we've discovered
Here are our overwhelming dreams, show me more and more of them!

Courage is important, so let's hurry and go!
Wish for it with all your might
Right now, let's go!

Let's use our frustration too; we'll turn it into something positive
When things get unbearable, it's okay to be a bit selfish
It's fine, so let's go!

Our love grants an unbeatable power
Grab it, grab it, grab it, reach for it!

No one knows about these treasures yet
They're all searching for them, yes, everyone's trying hard
These undiscovered treasures
Are so close, yet so far, they'll never stop shining

We've discovered treasures right here and now
Lots of them; they're everyone's smiles
The treasures we've discovered
Here are our overwhelming dreams, show me more and more of them!/nYes, now (Now, all of us)
We might understand (We've truly come to realize)
Something wonderful (all too wonderful)
As if we're fishes swimming through a dream

We've always (no matter when)
Felt like this (When we're with you)
And that's why we've always (all the way till now)
Been able to do things without fail

I only want to bring you passionate feelings
(Alright!) Until my voice fails
(Here we go!) I'll try saying it out loud
Will you answer back?

Thank you, FRIENDS!!
I'm glad we met, I'm glad we met
It's the best kind of bond
It's like life sometimes surprises us with a present
Hey, I'm glad we met, I'm glad we met
What kind of miracle is this?
While whispering "Don't disappear", we rush out even further ahead

The days that have passed (now so far away)
We can't return to them (though I miss them dearly)
But our future (let's start together)
Will begin over and over

I cried out so much, my feelings for you, but it's still not enough
(Alright!) Until my voice fails
(Let's go) I'll keep calling out
So will you answer back?

Thank you, friends!
I love you, I love you
I've always wanted to say it!
I want to see this scenery, and surely you had the same dream too
Hey, I love you, I love you
I want to play it on a loop, I want to sing!
I want you to say it too, so everyone, let out your voice!

How many of our dreams have we realized?
Let's make even more of them come true.
The number of heart racing moments we bore,
Ahh, they can't be counted
The sea breaze
Invites us.
In our hearts
Waves are rising, rising
Where, where should we head now?
Let's search for it together!

Thank you my friends
Eternal friends
I think it's wonderful, that we can say words like 'eternal'

Thank you, FRIENDS!!
I'm glad we met, I'm glad we met
It's the best kind of bond
It's like life sometimes surprises us with a present
Hey, I'm glad we met, I'm glad we met
What kind of miracle is this?
While whispering "Don't disappear", we rush out even further ahead

I love you, I want to sing with you
I want to say it forever, that I'll always love you
I want to have fun with you, forever.../nMy future, I'll try, try, try
To run towards it earnestly
My future, I'll try, try, try
To run towards it earnestly

You don't want to be disappointed
But what do you intend to protect?
Isn't it fine to feel down too
Climb aboard this seesaw game

I've cried over and over again
Because I want to be overwhelmed with emotion
Don't you hate being wishy-washy?
I've decided on a happy choice

Don't run away (barely making it) but (within this world)
The dashing future
Thrilling one way
That is what's truly full of prospects
I just want to feel the warmth of life

My overflowing feelings can't be stopped, can't be stopped
It's my heart's wish to play across this world
My overflowing feelings can't be stopped, can't be stopped
It's not for anyone else's sake, but for my own selfish passion


Are you being proud with pride?
Give it up, let's go and be bad
What I absolutely want to do is
to aim for your mono Poker Face

I will not yield it
As it's rude to my opponent
These Setbacks are inevitable
When grabbing the Lucky Star

Anxiously (Also astray) finding (The Path)
Running to the future (My future)
Thrilling One Way
That's what my true instinct is
I just want to feel the burning fire of life

This messy wish can't be stopped, can't be stopped
It's our ambition to fulfill it across this world
This messy wish can't be stopped, can't be stopped
Everyone is hiding it
Just do it for yourself, let's go!

It's getting hot
It's getting hot
I want to feel that I am living


Barely making through the dashing future
That is what's truly full of prospects
I just want to feel the warmth of life

My overflowing feelings can't be stopped, can't be stopped
It's my heart's wish to play across this world
My overflowing feelings can't be stopped, can't be stopped
It's not for anyone else's sake, but for my own selfish passion
Just do it for yourself, let's go!

My future, I'll try, try, try
To run towards it earnestly
My future, I'll try, try, try
To run towards it earnestly/nIf you sketch out your dreams, what will they look like?
Once you get fired up, no one can stop you
I want everyone to know that, that's probably how I feel

What should we do to achieve that?
If I was alone, that would be a bit difficult
It might be possible with everyone, let's get everyone involved

OH NO! Don't say it's impossible, please give it a try
OH NO! Try it even if it's impossible, I want to see a different future
We can go ahead!!

Even if it's an unreachable star (Star light, I hope you)
Keep on reaching out with your momentum
Don't decide that it's unreachable (Star light, I hope you)
Reach out! Worry about things later!

Aspirations are wonderful, you know?
Anyway, I want to imitate all of them
I'm sure everyone understands as well, come on, let's dance

OH NO! Don't say that you've lost, I don't want to be belittled
OH NO! It doesn't matter even if you've lost, this feeling is great
We can dance again!!

There are nights one can't sleep too (Bad night, I miss you)
Don't get discouraged, let's continue on
If you think you can't sleep (Bad night, I miss you)
Then get up! Here, I'll keep you company!


There are nights one can't sleep too, no one knows what lies ahead
If you think you can't sleep (Bad night, I miss you)

Keep on reaching out with your momentum
Don't decide that it's unreachable (Star light, I hope you)
Reach out! Worry about things later!
Reach out! Worry about things later!/nWhy do I think? Why do I think?

Things such as dreamlike scenery and dreamlike happiness
If I call them "dreamlike", it wouldn't be a dream anymore

Complex talk is background music to me, where is my curiosity?
The name that came to mind at that time was a surprising one

Why is it
When I tried raising the lid on my emotions, they overflowed
Why is it
Just imagining it makes my ears grow hot

I just started learning that there're different types of excitement
That's why research is necessary
I wish that you could help me
It's not something on paper, but much more personal
That's why research is necessary
Help me unravel this mystery

Things such as dreamlike encounters and dreamlike coincidences
Don't call them "dreamlike", it's fine just as a dream right?

That's how it is
Don't erase these wonderful memories, don't destroy them
That's how it is
I love the excitement from my imagination alone

"Hesitation only gets in the way", you said as you pulled me out
I'm always going with my whims
If our bodies collide, will I discover something new?
In the midst of this new excitement, my heart took flight
I'm always going with my whims
If I try starting with my body...

Why is it my emotions are overflowing
That's how it is
The heart-throbs are uncountable

I just started learning that there're different types of excitement
That's why research is necessary
I wish that you could help me
It's not something on paper, but much more personal
That's why research is necessary
Help me unravel this mystery
If I throw away my hesitation... will there be excitement?

Why do I think? Why do I think?/nBeing born is an excitement; being drawn is a shine
The world that started changing ever since that day
Just looking isn't enough, move your body!
Let's start searching for something that we can do

Is this a dream? "Dream" is an amazing word
Just saying puts you in a good mood
It's definitely a dream!
Ah, courage comes welling up within me!

An exciting achievable story
What it will be depend on us
Just having encounters is a miracle
An exciting achievable story
Let's start having fun together!
My liveliness is screaming out – I want to feel that 

(With you, who wants to feel excitement)
(A story that should be exciting)
Start on it!
(You should get excited too)/nI believe in the magic of words
You'll someday become my captive
Always look at me no matter what!! PLEASE

I'll make preparations
I don't know which words can convey my love
Though my sighs convey my passion

Just once, if there ever was a chance
When will that time ever be... I'll definitely capture you!

AH! No one knows any shortcuts to love
But, hey? LOVE ME!
"Because I'll make you happy"
Maybe this is correct? The magic spell of love

Even if I wait, you won't look back
You're just a friend like always
Notice my surging heart!! PLEASE

I want to infer
I don't know which words can make you my captive
Acting casually even though I'm observing you

If that chance was given to someone else
No way, I don't want you taken away... I'll definitely capture you!

AH! Maybe I'm just in love with the concept of love
Hey, that may be fun too, right?

Just once, if there ever was a chance
When will that time ever be... I'll definitely capture you!

AH! No one knows any shortcuts to love
But, hey? LOVE ME!
"Because I'll make you happy"
Maybe this is correct? The magic spell of love/nShould we go over there? (Oh no!)
Should we go over here? (Oh no!)
Which way should we go to? We don-don-don-don't know!

Go! We always want to live with this freedom
Oh yeah! We just noticed it
So come on, should we run away? Yes we should do it!
Don't try to stop us now Bye-bye

While we're running around, thinking without a care
Sweaty and impatient Oh, man it's too hot
If we break out our voice, they surely could find us
The shape of our lips should tell it right away

Going up, down, and up again (this looks like a maze)
Crossing here, turning there and again (we are running away)
I think I ran too much and it's getting painful
Why are we all laughing? We cannot stop it now

That is why even if I'm the one who's being chased
Even if you really are chasing me
Going around and around, we are drawing a full circle
Even though I don't want to be caught I sure look like I want it
This has slowly came to be fun so Runaway Forever!?

We want to live with more of this freedom
Oh yeah We just noticed it
So come on, should we run away? Yes we should do it!
Don't try to stop us now Bye-bye

If you get tired, that would be a problem
I'm getting really thirsty Oh man, that sure hurts!
If you think you may be somewhat cold-hearted
The people over here seem to be nice and warm

Going up, down, and up again (Oh no I slipped)
Crossing here, turning there and again (shall we fly away?)
I was running out of breath and that was my limit
But our feet are leading the way so come on, we are not going to stop!

We knew that we're just being chased around
That's one thing we can't go back on
Going around and around, we are swirling like a soup
It is slowly being boiled down, do you think it's time to taste it?
Will it be hot? Sure it is hot! But we don't notice it!

Around the Mobius Loop, around the Mobius Loop
We want to always run away and be chased!

We knew that we were just being chased around
That's one thing we can't go back on
Going around and around, we are swirling like a soup
It is slowly being boiled down, do you think it's time to taste it?
Will it be hot? Sure it is hot! It's nature is being hot!

Even if I'm the one who's being chased
Even if you really are chasing me
Going around and around, we are drawing a full circle
Even though I don't want to be caught, I sure look like I want it
This has slowly came to be fun so Runaway Forever!?
Escaping the Mobius Loop or Runaway runaway forever!?

We always want to live with this freedom
Oh yeah We just noticed it
Come on, should we run away? Yes we should do it!
Don't try to stop us now Bye-bye/nHey, hey! Ah… we are Busters! 

Trouble is piling up into a mountain, it can't be helped

I think my experience points have increased (That’s right, that’s right)
Don’t mind it and find my love, oh yeah!
(Trouble Busters! Irritated Busters!)

All right, from guys (Hey, you!)
All right, I want friendship please (Come on!)
